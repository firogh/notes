#What happened to kernel and me
This article is the my enssence answer  to "kernel".
How could I become a linux kernel hacker. The question is exist for a long long time.
And I didn't get the true answers, I read many book and web-page to understand kernel.
I am still not to get in touch with kernel hacking. I am just reading.
What happened to me?

In recently, I read Wittgenstein's book and got the philosophy of life.
I am not on the kernel-way that make me be very far from kernel.

What is kernel-way, it's the connecion, contributing, community.
We need to keep touch with others. Many programmer contribute their life kernel source code 
and make it stronger.

Finally, I get the answer, join with other, goto kernel community.

#What could I can do?
It's hard question to answer!
In my company, I do a little kernel hacking and *never* submit out modifications to kernel matainer!
It's so suck!
And more, I am really didn't good at on kernel hacking even though I have been many many boooks on kernel.
Based on the realities, I can't submmit the feature to kernel community!
I can fix BUGs!

#Fix bugs
=kernel oops
Yes, I can do it! I found kerneloops.org(It's hard to access, because of DB error.:-) store many kernel oops info.
It's the best work for me:
1. Connect with community.
2. Improve understanding of kernel.
It's so hard, I can't do anyone .....:-(((((((((

=kernel junitor and some other work
clean kernel code

=summary kernel knowledge and skill


=Write kernel code
