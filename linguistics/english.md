[5 principles and 7 actions][https://daringtolivefully.com/how-to-learn-a-new-language]
1. Focus on language content that is relevant to you.
2. No Chinese 
Use the new language as a tool to communicate. Instead of simply learning the language in an academic setting, put yourself in situations which force you to use the language in order to be able to communicate with others.
3. Comprehensible input
4. Learning a language is not about acquiring knowledge. Instead, in many ways it’s about physiological training.
5. Your psychological state matters. If  you’re  sad,  angry,  worried,  or upset, you’re  not  going  to  learn the new language. 

The Seven Actions
1. Listen; a lot. 
2. Focus on getting the meaning first, even before you get the words. 
3. Start mixing.
4. Focus on the core. With every language there’s high frequency content. As an illustration, in English, one thousand words cover 85% of anything you’re going to say in daily life. Three-thousand words give you 98% coverage. All the other words in the English language are the icing on the cake.
5. Get a language parent.
6. Copy the face.  In order to learn to make the sounds that will allow you to speak the new language, you have to watch the face of people who speak that language. 
7. “Direct Connect” to mental images. Most people learning to speak another language will make a list of words that they want to learn in their mother tongue, and next to each word they’ll place the equivalent in the language that they’re trying to learn. Then they just go over the list repeatedly in the hopes of memorizing the words in the new language. This is very inefficient.

## the enlish forms
Abstructios: english is way of connection between meanings and expressions
Quantaty: great large number => work set, JIT
Complexicty granularity: well-distributed, low/small => practice
Causality or practice:  practice
Material: sound, writen
Work-set: yes
Growing way: sound->written
### the english problems
I rest my case;
Unfamiliar words: imperial
Unknown words
### the units for Enlish
speech sounds
written language
various real life world most of them cannot described
### the way
input and output: output >> input:7/3
Input: watch game show, anime, movie, talk show, youtube
Input sounds: kindle narration, Soramimi, pure audible
Input written: website news, daily mail
Output-input: narrative listening, listen by heart, dictation, talking
Output: talking, writing, real-life -> English
Output sounds: none
Output writen: writting, real-life -> English
### Life-relevant contents.
No Chinese
limited non-life-relevant contents 10%:"audible, kindle, news, youtube."
Real-life -> meaning space -> English
JIT
Semantic net should be made up of real-life using, not search and synonym/thesaurus. 
It shouldn't be a game of play with words.
# Language acquisition
1. If a world were not have any language, the meaning does exist!
2. Cognition/thought breeds language, every language has its own express way.
Chinese: 那个位子空着吗?
Enlish: Is that seat vacant? (Not use 'empty').
3. Learning language is a process of 'copy', not creating something new.
4. The essence of language is using words to expres words.
