# Referencing count
/*
 * Methods to modify the page usage count.
 *
 * What counts for a page usage:
 * - cache mapping   (page->mapping)
 * - private data    (page->private)
 * - page mapped in a task's page tables, each mapping
 *   is counted separately
 *
 * Also, many kernel routines increase the page count before a critical
 * routine so they can be sure the page doesn't go away from under them.

 * Drop a ref, return true if the refcount fell to zero (the page has no users)
