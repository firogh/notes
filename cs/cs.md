What's the computer science? Have you ever asked yourself? It's not a science! 
Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that “com-
puter science” is not a science and that its significance has little to do
with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we
think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this
change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epis-
temology —the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative
point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken
by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework
for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a
framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”  -- The omnipotent SICP

## Procedure or subroutine
https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/subroutines.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine
* 1945 Turing on subroutines in [Proposed electronic calculator.](http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/archive/p/p01/P01-011.html)
In Chapter 6. Outline of Logical Control.
We also wish to be able to arrange for the splitting up of operations into...
When we wish to start on a subsidiary operation we need only make a note
of where we left off the major operation...
* 1952 [The use of sub-routines in programmes](http://www.laputan.org/pub/papers/wheeler.pdf)
The above remarks may be summarized by saying sub-routines are very useful — although not absolutely necessary — and that the prime objectives to be born     in mind when constructing them are simplicity of use, correctness of codes and accuracy of description. All complexities should—if possible—be buried out     of sight.
