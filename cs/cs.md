Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that “com-
puter science” is not a science and that its significance has little to do
with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we
think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this
change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epis-
temology —the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative
point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken
by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework
for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a
framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”  -- The omnipotent SICP
