# Change
type: resource
property: [subject, form, lack](https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/archange.htm)
energy is invisiable
structured matter for controling energy
data or state
kinetic and protenial energy
## wakeup

Periodical: 
Demand: seems overlap 
## sleep

# Processor
a set of strcutured matter for controling energy. 

# Process
type: resource, change
energized structured instructions 
machine states: states implies resource space 

# Turning machine
M=Q,Gamma ,b,Sigma ,delta ,q_{0},F
## Program Symbols
Gamma is a finite, non-empty set of tape alphabet symbols;
b in Gamma is the blank symbol (the only symbol allowed to occur on the tape infinitely often at any step during the computation);
Sigma subseteq Gamma setminus {b}: is the set of input symbols, that is, the set of symbols allowed to appear in the initial tape contents;
## Machine States
Q: is a finite, non-empty set of states;
q_{0} in Q is the initial state;
F subseteq Q is the set of final or accepting states.The initial tape contents is said to be accepted by M if it eventually halts in a state from F.
## Transition function/computing
type: structure causality
delta :(Q setminus F) * Gamma -> Q * Gamma * {L,R}:  is a partial function called the transition function, where L is left shift, R is right shift. (A relatively uncommon variant allows "no shift", say N, as a third element of the latter set.) If delta is not defined on the current state and the current tape symbol, then the machine halts;

# Cache
type: data
## Problems: slowness of storage medium
page cache: speed up the access to data on the secondary storage
dcache: speed up the access to data on the secondary storage
cpu cache: speed up the access to data on main memory
memory latency is the time (the latency) between initiating a request for a byte or word in memory until it is retrieved by a processor.
Bandwidth is the number of access per unit time.
[Cache motivation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch/lecture/5girw/motivation-for-caches)
[Bandwidth vs. Throughput](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWxGtl5J7WM)
## methods
a) locality: resouce space, medium: put data in a fast medium: Disk -> RAM; RAM -> cache; usually, the fast medium is small
b) locality: put hot data in a small place

### Write behavior

* write miss

write-around/no-write-allocate: non-temporal write operations
* write hit

uncacheable.
### cache coherency
* [MESI Cache Coherence Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p9tfMMu1PE)

* Write propagation: Changes to the data in any cache must be propagated to other copies(of that cache line) in the peer caches.
write-invalidate
write-update
* Write serialization
Snooping
Directory-based
two cores require write acess to the same memory address at the same exact moment? one proceeds and one stalls
