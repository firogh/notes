    Fix subtle bug in "finish_wait()", which can cause kernel stack
    corruption on SMP because of another CPU still accessing a waitqueue
    even after it was de-allocated.
    
    Use a careful version of the list emptiness check to make sure we
    don't de-allocate the stack frame before the waitqueue is all done.

* NOTE: using list_empty_careful() without synchronization
* can only be safe if the only activity that can happen
* to the list entry is list_del_init(). Eg. it cannot be used
* if another CPU could re-list_add() it.
[finish_wait with list_empty_careful maybe fragile or buggy??](https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/11/143)
Actually, it's not careful, but it's just specific.
