    [PATCH] writeback from address spaces
+ * The generic ->writepage function for buffer-backed address_spaces
 int block_write_full_page(struct page *page, get_block_t *get_block)

# Translation
__getblk_slow, grow_buffers, grow_dev_page, alloc_page_buffers
__getblk_gfp -> grow_dev_page -> buffer cache
__bread_gfp -> __getblk_gfp and submit_bh
__ext4_iget -> __ext4_get_inode_loc -> sb_getblk
ext4_write_inode
## Block mappings
page, block, sector
bio->bi_iter.bi_sector = bh->b_blocknr * (bh->b_size >> 9);	# sector_nr = blocknr * (block_size / 512)

设想一个场景，两个进程pa,pb同时追加写文件，如果直接申请块就马上给的话，就会出现pa申请的block在1,3,5…… pb申请的block在2,4，6……
bh_delay推迟块的分配时机到回写时候进行。这样pa和pb就能分别获取连续的物理块

# Buffer head and block
Is BUFFER_FNS BUFFER_FUNCTIONS?

    [PATCH] change buffer_head.b_size to size_t

## NOT MERGERED: BH_Delay, current usage of buffer_head by Jan Kara
[ext4: Deprecate nobh mount option](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/171199/)
	This option doesn't do anything interesting for ext4 anymore since we attach
	buffers to the page in page_mkwrite and in write_begin to support delayed
	allocation and properly handle ENOSPC caused by mmaped writes.

## Buffer new and mapped

    Import 2.3.9pre5
BH_New means newly created block has no data on block, which is different to !BH_Uptodate.

see tglx fs/buffer.c

# Buffer head necessary?

# Nobh
Compared to ext2_prepare_write(in turn __block_prepare_write), nobh_prepare_write doesn't has following code.
        if (!page_has_buffers(page))
                create_empty_buffers(page, blocksize, 0);
        head = page_buffers(page);

    ext4: remove vestiges of nobh support
    The nobh option was only supported for writeback mode, but given that all
    write paths actually create buffer heads it effectively was a no-op already.
## Why nobh
[Is nobh code still useful?](http://linux-kernel.2935.n7.nabble.com/Is-nobh-code-still-useful-td509649.html)
	Originally it was supported on ext2. I added support nobh support for
	ext3. At that time, the main
	issue/complaint was that, these bufferheads consume memory from
	ZONE_NORMAL causing
	memory pressure on 32-bit (i386) configurations.
	Thanks,
	Badari
	---------------------------------
	Specifically, it matters on very large configuration systems (i.e.,
	32GB-64GB using PAE-36) that today we'd probably just say, "use
	x86_64, you moron".  It would probably matter if someone were to want
	to upgrade a non-64-bit capable machine to a newer kernel.  

	Dropping nobh from ext3 at this point might prevent some of these
	older systems from upgrading, I'm not sure how much we would care; on
	the one hand, these machines tended to be pretty expensive, so people
	would probably want to use them for a while.  On the other hand, it
	has been over five years now since x86_64 machines have been
	available, and many of these customers are highly unlikely to want to
	upgrade anyway.
