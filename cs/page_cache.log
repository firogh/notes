# History 
## Buffer cache
[Beefing Up the Buffer Cache](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11sLlREfK_3EnEK_BlqnOxVGFUFnDbQVs/view?usp=sharing) and [UBC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZY2MaoJCb8R317ZjLfGdvxcKq4Jo_k6i/view?usp=sharing)
Starting from stable version 2.4.10, the buffer cache does not really exist anymore. In
fact, for reasons of efficiency, block buffers are no longer allocated individually;
instead, they are stored in dedicated pages called “buffer pages,” which are kept in
the page cache.  -- ULK Chapter 15: Storing Blocks in the Page Cache
Section Storing Blocks in Page Cache is invaluable; 

Block buffers: This descriptor contains all the information needed by the kernel to know how to handle the block;
thus, before operating on each block, the kernel checks its buffer head.

Buffer pages: attach_page_buffers
Block device buffer pages
grow_buffers-> grow_dev_page
try_to_release_page
Buffer cache: Inode is stored on the buffer cache; check sync_inode_metadata and __ext2_write_inode

    mm: speculative page references
	[...]
    Thanks to Hugh for pointing out an improvement to the algorithm setting
    page_count to zero when we have control of all references, in order to
    hold off speculative getters.

PLKA
To manage the various target objects that can be processed and cached in whole pages, the kernel uses
an abstraction of the ‘‘address space‘‘that associates the pages in memory with a specific block device (or
any other system unit or part of a system unit).
This type of address space must not be confused with the virtual and physical
address spaces provided by the system or processor. It is a separate abstraction of
the Linux kernel that unfortunately bears the same name.
