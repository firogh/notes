# HP
A program is synchronized if all accesses to shared data are ordered by synchronization operations.
A data reference is ordered by a synchronization operation if, in every possible
execution, a write of a variable by one processor and an access (either a read or a
write) of that variable by another processor are separated by a pair of synchroni-
zation operations, one executed after the write by the writing processor and one
executed before the access by the second processor???. Cases where variables may
be updated without ordering by synchronization are called data races because the
execution outcome depends on the relative speed of the processors, and, like
races in hardware design, the outcome is unpredictable, which leads to another
name for synchronized programs: data-race-free.

# Why we need synchronization
a critical section is a piece of code that accesses a shared resource 
(data structure or device) that must not be concurrently accessed by more than one thread of execution.

This overlap, where the result depends on the relative timing of multiple tasks, is called a race condition. 
# How to use synchronization mechanism

## Common usage
Protect from interruption by hardware interrupts:
        local_irq_disable(int irq) & local_irq_enable(int irq)
Protection from software interrupts:
        local_bh_disable(void) & local_bh_enable(void)
Protection from other CPUs:
        spin_lock(spinlock_t *) & spin_unlock(spinlock_t *)
Preemption by other user contexts:
        preempt_disable(void) & preempt_enable(void) 
# What is synchronization in computer science 
[Synchronize](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=synchronize)
synchronization means be of the same time.
It means "make it synchronous", something like coexistence.

Process synchronization refers to the idea that multiple processes are 
to join up or handshake at a certain point, in order to reach an 
agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action.

# Memory barier

# Per-CPU

# Local Interrupt Disabling
local_irq_disable() used in the code path that never disabled interrupts.
local_irq_save(flags) used in the code path that already disabled interrupts.
