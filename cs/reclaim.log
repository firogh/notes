# GFP
If get_order(size) > PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER, then this will fail even
without the __GFP_NORETRY.  To make the guarantee that workloads are not
receiving ENOMEM, it seems like we'd need to guarantee that allocations
going through io_mem_alloc() are sufficiently small.

For order > PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER, maybe we can use
__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL. It will at least do more aggressive reclaim
though I think that is a separate discussion. For this issue, we are
seeing ENOMEMs even for order 0 allocations.
