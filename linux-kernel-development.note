* Introduction to the linux kernel 
  NB:
  This is my first formal,solemn note of reading books.
  I just want to make what have been learned clear. 
  For this purpose, I will make best explain my reading to you via these notes.

  As we all known that Robert love is grand master on kernel hacking.LKD is a nice to get started to linux kernel.

* System calls
  NB:
  Now,11-25-11,you know I need get more knowledge on kernel hacking.
** Get startted
   As we all known,all the hardware machine rescources are on the control of kernel.
   By the reason,if we need the resorce ,we shuold to apply for it to kernel.This is the way,you can do is comply with it. 
   Syscall is a meesenger between applications and the kernel,keep it in mind.
   The reason for the existence of syscall is to provide  a stable system.
   Do you think so?
** Communicating with the kernel
** Syscalls serve 3 primary purposes.
   1.It provides an abstracted hardware interface for user-space.
   2.Middle-man,ensure system security and stability.
   3.Build a foundation to virtualized system provide processes.
** Three legal entry point into kernel
    1.Systemcall
    2.Exceptions
    3.Traps
** API,POSIX,libc
   The manner in which the function is used is not any of the kernel's business.
** Syscall
** System call context
* Kernel data structures
  There are 4 built-in data structures which are all our old friends.
  Linked lists,queues,maps,Binary trees.
** Linked lists
   Singly , doubly ,circular linked list.
   Although the Linux kernelâ€™s linked list implementation is unique, it is fundamentally a
   circular doubly linked list. Using this type of linked list provides the greatest flexibility.


* Interrupts and interrupt handlers
** Common concepts
   Interrupts;exceptions;IRQ lines; Interrupt handlers,ISR is part of 
   the device's driver;Interrupt/atomic context.
   Top halves versus bottom halves
** 
  1.CPU is very fast than  other devices.
  2.To respondce to devices ,cpu can use polling and interrupt mechanisms.Which on is better.
  3.Device interrupt controller -> CPU -> kernel
  4.asynchronously , synchronous; interrupts, exceptions.
  5.IRQ lines



* An introduction to kernel synchronization
** Important concepts
   * Critical regions;race conditions;
     pseudo-concurrency; true concurrency;
** 

* Memory management
** FAQ 
   1.Why kernel can't treat all pages as identical in terms of hardware limitations.
   
** Concepts
   1.Page:the kernel treats physical pages as the basic unit of memory management.
   2.MMU:the hardware that manages memory and performs virtual to physical address.
   3.Zone:The kernel uses the zones to group pages of similar properties.
   4.Slab:act as a generic data structure-caching layer.
   5.caches:the slab layer divides different objects into groups.
   6.Interrupt stacks:provide a single per-processor stack used for interrupt handlers.
   7.Kernel stack:minimize your usage,serveral hundred Bytes.
   8.High memory:physical memory that higher 896MB
   9.Logical address:Just offset(3G~3G+896MB) of the physical address,no need to mmu.
   10.Virtual address:(3G~4G).Use mmu to translate it to physical address. 
   11.Per-Cpu data:data that is unique to a given processor.
   11.1.Reasons for using Per-cpu data:reduce lock.
** Mechanism
   1.Memory access
   alloc_pages,__get_free_pages:allocates contiguous physical pages
   alloc_page,__get_free_page: same to premises.
   get_zeroed_page:page filled with zeros.
   kmalloc:obtaining kernel memory in byte-sized chunks.ultimately alloc_pages.
   vmalloc:only virtually contiguous can be guaranteed,beget TLB trashing
   kmem_getpages:allocate memory sufficient to hold the cache.
   kmem_cache_create:
   kmem_cache_alloc:allocate object from cache.
   kmap:mappings low and high memory on both cpu,permanently.
   kmap_atomic:can use in interrupt handlers.
   get_cpu:get current processor and disable kernel preemption.difference to smp_processor_id().
   put_cpu:enable kernel preemption.
