How to print backtrace by kernel oops, and why it's not exact?

What is .byte in oops
 3f:   31                      .byte 0x31 
 Nevermind that .byte 0x31 - it's just a truncated instruction (we have one
 starting with 31 just several lines above). 

What is abi


why get_unaligned_be16?
 _THIS_IP_ vs __FUNCTIONS__

##net

*first_device 用途？
subsys 在前, device在后.

* What is bridge?

linux bridge 
netdev_rx_handler_register(dev, br_handle_frame, p);
__netif_receive_skb -> rx_handler=br_handle_frame
and generic concept: hub, switch?
hub: layer 1, bradcast, exclusive share, 报文可被侦听.
switch: layer 2,  mac port route, CAM table in linux bridge module!
switch with vlan: layer 3, 因为vlan之间的报文转发需要路由, 所以是layer层技术.

*What is the type in ip link?
net_poll
napi

* What is Head-of-line blocking
