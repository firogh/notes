If the crash dump can't be triggered from the keyboard then we might try to trigger it automatically. We could try the kernel parameters

# cgroup memory track
Let's try cgroup to narrow down these suspicious tasks to a small range.
Please, request customer:

1. add DefaultMemoryAccounting=yes to /etc/systemd/system.conf
2. add slab_nomerge to the kernel commandline
3. reboot
4. Then we have all kernel memory usage for each task under /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/; collect them with:

while sleep 10; do tar -czvf cgroup_memory_$(date +%s).tar.gz /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/; done

5. stop command in step 4 if kmalloc-2048 goes beyond 10GB - 16GB in /proc/slabinfo

6. send all tar balls to me.
