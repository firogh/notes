## English determiners
### article: the 逻辑上的
An article (abbreviated art) is a word (or prefix or suffix) that is used with 
a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun. 
Articles specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, 
in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope. 
a/an some 值不确定, the 是确定后面可以跟复数. 
Zero article:复数和不可数名词没有冠词,貌似代表全部 reference to a general class of things. 

* 为什么冠词叫article 和文章是同一个词?
article的词源是separate parts of anything written 符合文章的涵义, 
而冠词表示后面的名词之前是否提及过, 也有separate的涵义.
### demonstrative: that/this 空间上

## 时态
ing表示持续, 对应一段时间; 表示正在, 对应另一event

## FAQ
[complementation in english a minimalist approach](http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/cornilescu/cuprins.htm)

Gerund & Infinitive Usage , 关键还是看是否要做, 句子更倾向哪个动词.

You will find the following guidelines for gerund/infinitive usage helpful.

• I stopped worrying about the future.
In this example, the worrying was real and it happened until I stopped.
• We really enjoy climbing mountains.
In this example, the climbing is real and it’s something we like to do.
* Infinitives
Infinitives are best for use in sentences about actions that are unreal or abstract, or that will occur in the future.
• I’d like you to think about something.
In this example, I’m asking you to think about something, but the thinking hasn’t happened yet.
• Can we take a walk without you stopping to smoke?
