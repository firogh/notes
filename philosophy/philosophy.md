title: Quantitative congnition - The philosophy on which I am living
category: philosophy

I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to understand this world.
The following thoughts try to help people to make a good life. They are out of my past life.

# Recognize subjectivity
First of all, you should know what is subjectivity and objectivity in philosophy.
In my opinion, subjectivity is the most important thing you should know then anything else.
Try to find when morden philosophy rose and why. Hint: read some works of Rene Descartes.
I found some bad effects of sujective mind:
* Deceptive objectivity. The worst case is it make you deem that unstanding is equivalent to doing. 
* False target or procedure.(For English, 英语去学TTC的哲学课程, 和用英语与印度技术人员沟通, 这才是真正的目标, 而不是背单词,考试)(K2:以为看懂kernel, 就能做了)
* Deceptive understanding, wrong and absent(not excessive abstraction). 
* shirk hardship, seek comfort and enjoyment.
* Frequently changing.
* Fading away along the time.
* Neglect objectivity.
* radical fallibility. -- Soros
* Overconfident subjective understanding. -- on larning kernel
* Subjective paralysis;Easy to perform and achieve in subjectivity makes objectivity lose interest.
* Flash across

The bad effects of Objectivity
* captivated by the objectivity, didn't find the orign of world. (K2: 以为看过kernel绝大多数实现,样子就理解了kernel, 那只是更长的Feynman所说的名字, 是cramming)

# World/object/The origins of the world
Zur Sach selbst! ... to the things themselves!-- Husserl, Wittgenstein
有生命的知识; 问题是种子, 知识是花.

* 不带有色眼光的, 看待事情知识本身. 别说什么你不感兴趣, 有些内容与计算机无关. 这都容易, 造成认知对象的消失, 从而偏见与盲目.
* 我失败的地方, 

 Why do I deem and use reading  kernel book to understanding the internal knowledge of kernel as my way to kernel hacking? I think, at that time, learn to know how something work is knowledge, right? This is my fatal mistake. What I want to know is a solution. But the process to know the solution is too bad. The result is I cannot fully understand the solution like Feynman's methods do .
* In short, 1. I didn't fully understand how others solved problem. 2. I didn't solve a problem.
* 更为核心的问题是, 我以为knowledge是static, 而且只知道理解这个点. 实际上知识作为在engineering field, knowledge 是依附于工程的实际问题. 也就是knowledge 在问题不在的时候是削弱的. 也就是说, 解决的能力才是最重要的. 能力是一种知识pattern. 这种能力也是一种'知识', 绝不能被其他知识取代. 另外就是, 知识本身的生长过程.
subjective 知识的根, 如果根被拔掉了, 那知识就没有意义了.'static知'识, 自然的生长.而作为问题的根尤为重要. 知识形式往往很复杂,浪费大量精力. 知识的生成, 胡适的历史方法, 知识不在是某种固定的思维结构, 而是动态的, 这种动态体现在, 知识依附于问题.
objective doing 层面的根. 怎么用.解决问题的能力与体现, 才是重中之重, 而不是对于'所谓的'static的知识的falsh across. 这两种都是隐形的知识, 你不思考,不能抓住他们的形.
The hidden darkness. 是什么组织了我们认识, 完善自我. 知识被人有意识的隐藏了起来(如中共高层领导与钱的关系), 另外就是人们不具备合理的能力理解知识.
高度抽象的式不加冗余的理解. 之前很多时间浪费在了, kernel很多琐碎的细节知识没有在融汇贯通(尤其是, 没有得到抽象的精简的知识), 很片面. 浪费了很多时间.
Know how to solve every problem that has been solved. -- Feynman
* Before you start to deal a problem, inspect and examine the problem and the known method, especially for a complex problem e.g. Learning a new language or kernel
* From inspecting and examining the known method, you get some hints to make a method which is suitable for you to solve the problem. Why US people is able to use english, more general reason, they spent much time on variant fields of life, but we do these rarely. These are the hints I can get. And I can quantize the 'time' and 'fields' to compare it with what a native English person did.
* From inspecting and examining the problem, if will help you to get the right method, not defrauded by the subjectivity. For english learning, not learning english but using english.
Nothing new under the sun.
