title: Quantitative cognition - The philosophy on which I am living
category: philosophy
---

I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to understand this world.
The following thoughts try to help people to make a good life. They all came from my past life.
# Life & Gratification
All we are doing is gratification, even through boring things or nothing.
Did you ask yourself on why you do some specifical things without special intention?
Reward: some reward must be paid in a healthy way. Physiological needs: relax, food, water, sex, etc.
In my colleague life, I learned very hard with a strong specific motivation. But now, I have a motivation. But not do it as my colleague.
No passion? No reward! Why? masturbation.
If you did it, you finnally got the following word.
Retrocausality.
It's amazing that we know them before we got them. It's not the nutural progressing way in some degrees.
* Zland: Physiological needs: food, water, air, sex;Respect and fulfill my feelings.
安静而有节制的生活能比始终在不安困扰下追求成功带来更多的喜悦 --Einstein
A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness
* Showing-off: in front of interviewer
kzenowalker: feeling/desire; 
I have a inclination on wasting time. So must enforce what I do.
谷歌表示，该中心将在北京拥有一个专家团队，谷歌已在北京有数百名从事研发和其他工作的员工。谷歌AI中国中心将由李飞飞和李佳领导。李飞飞是斯坦福大学人工智能实验室的负责人，领导着谷歌云业务的人工智能部门；李佳是谷歌云业务的人工智能部门研发主管。
* Vicariousness 
It is harm for learning knowledge. I have a inclination on using vicarious method.
It brings: quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
Learning by doing will make you learn lots practical knowledge.
I found some bad effects of sujective vicarious mind:
Deceptive objectivity. The worst case is it make you deem that unstanding is equivalent to doing. 以为看懂kernel, 就能做了
Reading kernel book is looking the output of others's minds. It's something like 'flash across'. So it's fake of objectivity. That's why I read kernel book. Reading is ok because of we are Tabula rasa.
Overconfident subjective understanding. -- on larning kernel
Deceptive understanding, wrong and absent(not excessive abstraction). 
shirk hardship, seek comfort and enjoyment.
Neglect objectivities. 现实要比主观复杂多了.
Subjective paralysis;Easy to perform and achieve in subjectivity makes objectivity lose interest.
* Unknown and unawear are another big barrier for me to achive what I want.
Know how to solve every problem that has been solved. -- Feynman
People cannot see something wihout being denominated
不带有色眼光的, 看待事情知识本身. 别说什么你不感兴趣, 有些内容与计算机无关. 这都容易, 造成认知对象的消失, 从而偏见与盲目.
* emotional, conscious, desire:
Avoid the boring brought by being conscious on doing same things.
stimulation and thrill
Joy:laugher
Sympathy:vicarious, virtualization.
* Willpower: An idea is likes a seed; once planted in a person's mind, it's growth is determined by how well it is nourished. Without lasting relevance it might wither and die or become ousted by other ideas that occupy a larger space in the mindspace of the host. Some ideas though, once planted, strike roots and grow from a captivating notion into a fundamental ideology that overshadows and influences every thought that blossoms in it's wake." -- Homo Ludens or: Kojima's Evolution of Mankind (Death Stranding), RagnarRox
I don't want to be a natural roamer.
大部分的学习无效是因为没有强制性输出结果的压力.
If one thing is a must, do it now.
* Our minds is always fickle, unstable, vacillating. Sometimes the important side  is that our minds is partial, biased, unreliable. We cannot rely on it.
* Auto extend
# The architect
* Watch out vicariousnees!!
We don't have to remember/understand the things contrived by people. What we need to remember is the fact which leads this contriving!
精通围棋规则和精通围棋.
从实际应用场景出发, 而不是代码片段.
在计算机领域，很多人喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则殆，就是这个道理。书籍让你记住了现成的“事实”，却不能让你拥有产生出这些知识的能力。 -- Wangyin
它们只是把你“训练”（train）成了循规蹈矩的流水线工人，而不能让你受到真正的“教育”（education）。真正的好书都是很薄的，“把厚书读薄”这句话其实是误导的。厚书本来就不应该拿来读，最多可以拿来当字典查。所以我的建议是：如果你想成为天才，就避免去读厚书。去寻找简短的书来入门，然后就可以自己思考了。这就是我从 Nash 的故事得到的启发。 Wangyin
"除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应。 -- N Why I Am So Clever  Section8
叔本华思想随笔: 论思考
Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, other-
wise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read
nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done
myself!—That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute
beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is
what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it
spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s
periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at
Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what
this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The
other kind simply followed on from this.
* Sorcerer

避免陷入大量细节,不要求大求全.
不要被知识迷惑,  declarative knowledge 和 Procedural knowledge不能互相取代. 每种知识的关注点是不同的, 也就是逻辑链不同, 虽然看似学得是同样的内容, 实质上, 本后的逻辑完全不同.
熟练读, 初级与大魔导使.
* I have never thought about questions that are not real ones—I have not squandered myself. -- N
What shouldn't we learn? 我不是要了解一个语言or设计的实现细节. 这毫无必要, 仅仅在记忆而已.
通过事物的本质属性去理解他, 如fluent python Figure 2-1. page 20. 而核心是"用"这个真正意图, 正如正本fluent python.
python的语言的存在是一种临时的纽带关系. 一旦确定用的场景, 语言本身迅速消失, 留下用的样子.
所以什么改学呢? 用本质理解事物, 以及事物的用处. 并不关心事物本身, 隐去它.
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.
[知识的“局限性”][1] 碎片化的知识无用, 碎片化知识切割人生.
[知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。][2] 区分无用的知识.
Doing right things:effectiveness
* Learning by doing
Do what you want.
Lean
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 --Goethe
来自日常工作中
socerer, 用起来, 释放魔法 lean.
从动手中学习（learn by doing）by Wang Yin;如果你看过 John Nash 的传记《A Beautiful Mind》，就会发现他与其他人的不同。Nash 看书只看封面和开头，把这书要讲的问题了解清楚之后，就自己动手解决。最后，他完全依靠自己的“头脑暴力”创造出整本书的内容。Nash 头脑里的数学知识，绝大部分是他自己造出来的，而不是看书看会的。也就是说，他把整个的研究领域作为一道道的练习题，用这种方式独立创造出了大部分的现代数学！Learn by doing, 这就是天才最重要的特征。
Draw you mind
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability][3]
Never control by descriptions which are completely divorced from reality.
We will be captivated by the objectivities/doings, can't find the orign of world. (K2: 以为看过kernel绝大多数实现,样子就理解了kernel, 那只是更长的Feynman所说的名字, 是cramming)
Zur Sach selbst! ... to the things themselves!-- Husserl, Wittgenstein
Doing concrete useful staff. Understanding with neat concise abstract maps. Never leave the ground!
小美好, [take the programs, modify them and enhance them.][7]  -- Stevens
basic forms from zero.
* Use Feynman and [Descartes's methods][6]
No book, only questions!
叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔 
inspecting and examining the problem will help us to get the right method, not defrauded by the subjectivity.

# The origins of the world
* Causality is abyss. Watch out origins.[Causal reasoning][8]
* Don't Expect Too Much.There is no perfect.Troubles come one by one. It will disapoint you finally.
* Nothing new under the sun.
* 知识是分逻辑依赖的 dependent ,轻重 缓急.
Causality order  quantities change relation
dependency, direction
Scalable
Cthulhu, unkonw world, hard to measure, unfalsifiable, unreality, unfathomable, Indeterminacy, unmeasurable, imponderable,indefinite, 
Repeat, irregularity, complexity
onset, nuclus, coda
Completeness, consistency, validity, soundness. -- Logic
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology
