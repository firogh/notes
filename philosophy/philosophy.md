title: Quantitative congnition - The philosophy on which I am living

I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to understand this world.
The following thoughts try to help people to make a good life. They are out of my past life.

# Recognize subjectivity
First of all, you should know what is subjectivity and objectivity in philosophy.
In my opinion, subjectivity is the most important thing you should know then anything else.
Try to find when morden philosophy rose and why. Hint: read some works of Rene Descartes.
I found some bad effects of sujective mind:
* Deceptive objectivity. The worst case is it make you deem that unstanding is equivalent to doing. 
* False target or procedure.(For English, 英语去学TTC的哲学课程, 和用英语与印度技术人员沟通, 这才是真正的目标, 而不是背单词,考试)(K2:以为看懂kernel, 就能做了)
* Deceptive understanding, wrong and absent(not excessive abstraction). 
* shirk hardship, seek comfort and enjoyment.
* Frequently changing.
* Fading away along the time.
* Neglect objectivity.
* radical fallibility. -- Soros
* Overconfident subjective understanding. -- on larning kernel

# Thank you, Mr Feynman
[What did Richard Feynman mean when he said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand"?][1]
[What is science by Feyman][2], do you know brown-throated thrush?

The bad effects of Objectivity
* captivated by the objectivity, didn't find the orign of world. (K2: 以为看过kernel绝大多数实现,样子就理解了kernel, 那只是更长的Feynman所说的名字, 是cramming)

# World/object/The origins of the world
Nothing new under the sun.
unkonw world, hard to measure, unfalsifiable, unreality, unfathomable, Indeterminacy, unmeasurable, imponderable,indefinite, 
Repeat, irregularity, complexity
There is nothing permanent except change. ――Heraclitus
onset, nuclus, coda
问题总是复杂的, 解决方法总是简单的.  --xiaolai.li
君子生非异也 善假于物也. -- 荀子
Completeness, consistency, validity, soundness. -- Logic
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology

# Descartes's methods
Divide every question into manageable parts. 
Begin with the simplest issues and ascend to the more complex.
Review frequently enough to retain the whole argument at once.
Accept as true only what is indubitable.
