I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to understand this world.
The following thoughts try to help people to make a good life. They are out of my past life.

# Recognize subjectivity
First of all, you should know what is subjectivity and objectivity in philosophy.
In my opinion, subjectivity is the most important thing you should know then anything else.
Try to find when morden philosophy rose and why. Hint: read some works of Rene Descartes.
I found some bad effects of sujective mind:
* Deceptive objectivity. The worst case is it make you deem that unstanding is equivalent to doing. 
* False target or procedure.(For English, 英语去学TTC的哲学课程, 和用英语与印度技术人员沟通, 这才是真正的目标, 而不是背单词,考试)(K2:以为看懂kernel, 就能做了)
* Deceptive understanding, wrong and absent(not excessive abstraction). 
* shirk hardship, seek comfort and enjoyment.
* Frequently changing.
* Fading away along the time.
* Neglect objectivity.
* radical fallibility. -- Soros
* Overconfident subjective understanding. -- on larning kernel
* Subjective paralysis;Easy to perform and achieve in subjectivity makes objectivity lose interest.

# Objective understanding
The origin of the world./structuralism?
Feynman's method.
Learning by doing.
Intuition
Trial and error/Scientific method
Critical learning  -- Popper, Aaron Swartz 25:20
[Descartes's methods][3]
Occam's razor 
Reflexivity -- Soros/Statistics-based method training. -- Firo
Things themselves - Husserl, Wittgenstein
Transformation cognition -- Firo
Falsifiability -- Popper

The bad effects of Objectivity
* captivated by the objectivity, didn't find the orign of world. (K2: 以为看过kernel绝大多数实现,样子就理解了kernel, 那只是更长的Feynman所说的名字, 是cramming)

# World/object/The origins of the world
Know how to solve every problem that has been solved. -- Feynman
* Before you start to deal a problem, inspect and examine the problem and the known method, especially for a complex problem e.g. Learning a new language.
* From inspecting and examining the known method, you get some hints to make a method which is suitable for you to solve the problem. Why US people is able to use english, more general reason, they spent much time on variant fields of life, but we do these rarely. These are the hints I can get. And I can quantize the 'time' and 'fields' to compare it with what a native English person did.
* From inspecting and examining the problem, if will help you to get the right method, not defrauded by the subjectivity. For english learning, not learning english but using english.
