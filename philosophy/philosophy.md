I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to understand this world.
The following thoughts try to help people to make a good life. They all come from my past life.
# Life & Gratification
All we are doing is gratification, even through boring things or nothing.
Did you ask yourself on why you do some specifical things without special intention?
Reward: some reward must be paid in a healthy way. Physiological needs: relax, food, water, sex, etc.
In my colleague life, I learned very hard with a strong specific motivation. But now, I have a motivation. But not do it as my colleague.
No passion? No reward! Why? masturbation.
If you did it, you finnally got the following word.
Retrocausality.
It's amazing that we know them before we got them. It's not the nutural progressing way in some degrees.
* Zland: Physiological needs: food, water, air, sex;Respect and fulfill my feelings.
安静而有节制的生活能比始终在不安困扰下追求成功带来更多的喜悦 --Einstein
A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness
* Showing-off: in front of interviewer
kzenowalker: feeling/desire; 
I have a inclination on wasting time. So must enforce what I do.
* Vicariousness 
It is harm for learning knowledge. I have a inclination on using vicarious method.
It brings: quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
Learning by doing will make you learn lots practical knowledge.
I found some bad effects of sujective vicarious mind:
Deceptive objectivity. The worst case is it make you deem that unstanding is equivalent to doing. 以为看懂kernel, 就能做了
Reading kernel book is looking the output of others's minds. It's something like 'flash across'. So it's fake of objectivity. That's why I read kernel book. Reading is ok because of we are	Tabula rasa.
Overconfident subjective understanding. -- on larning kernel
Deceptive understanding, wrong and absent(not excessive abstraction). 
shirk hardship, seek comfort and enjoyment.
Neglect objectivities. 现实要比主观复杂多了.
Subjective paralysis;Easy to perform and achieve in subjectivity makes objectivity lose interest.
* Unknown and unawear are another big barrier for me to achive what I want.
Know how to solve every problem that has been solved. -- Feynman
People cannot see something wihout being denominated
不带有色眼光的, 看待事情知识本身. 别说什么你不感兴趣, 有些内容与计算机无关. 这都容易, 造成认知对象的消失, 从而偏见与盲目.
* I have never thought about questions that are not real ones—I have not squandered myself. -- N
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.
[知识的“局限性”][1] 碎片化的知识无用, 碎片化知识切割人生.
[知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。][2] 区分无用的知识.
Doing right things:effectiveness
* emotional, conscious, desire:
Avoid the boring brought by being conscious on doing same things.
stimulation and thrill
Joy:laugher
Sympathy:vicarious, virtualization.
* Willpower: An idea is likes a seed; once planted in a person's mind, it's growth is determined by how well it is nourished. Without lasting relevance it might wither and die or become ousted by other ideas that occupy a larger space in the mindspace of the host. Some ideas though, once planted, strike roots and grow from a captivating notion into a fundamental ideology that overshadows and influences every thought that blossoms in it's wake." -- Homo Ludens or: Kojima's Evolution of Mankind (Death Stranding), RagnarRox
I don't want to be a natural roamer.
大部分的学习无效是因为没有强制性输出结果的压力.
If one thing is a must, do it now.
* Our minds is always fickle, unstable, vacillating. Sometimes the important side  is that our minds is partial, biased, unreliable. We cannot rely on it.
# The architect
* Learning by doing
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability][3]
Never control by descriptions which are completely divorced from reality.
We will be captivated by the objectivities/doings, can't find the orign of world. (K2: 以为看过kernel绝大多数实现,样子就理解了kernel, 那只是更长的Feynman所说的名字, 是cramming)
Zur Sach selbst! ... to the things themselves!-- Husserl, Wittgenstein
Doing concrete useful staff. Understanding with neat concise abstract maps. Never leave the ground!
小美好, [take the programs, modify them and enhance them.][7]  -- Stevens
basic forms from zero.
* Use Feynman and [Descartes's methods][6]
inspecting and examining the problem will help us to get the right method, not defrauded by the subjectivity.

[What did Richard Feynman mean when he said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand"?][4]
[What is science by Feyman][5], do you know brown-throated thrush?
* The origin of the world./structuralism?

Trial and error/Scientific method
Reflexicity -- Soros/Statistics-based method training. -- Firo

Nothing new under the sun.
世界如何变化取决于我们如何看她
每个伟大都来自渺小. -- Alien
