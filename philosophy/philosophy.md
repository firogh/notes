title: Quantitative cognition - The philosophy on which I am living
category: philosophy
---

I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to understand this world.
The following thoughts try to help people to make a good life. They all came from my past life.
# Ego life world
society will is much stronger(large) than individual's and will chip away individual's will.finally, we will be 无聊 庸俗 被社会吃掉, 自我的消逝.
个人应该做自己想做的事, 个人的意志体现个人的意愿也可能是意义, 甚至得到某种新的意志 意识, 神性的降临, 超越创造神.
个体成为自己, 成为自己的存在, 即便前路黑暗! 而不是被动的, 成为别的什么.
别人也只是在创造描绘这个世界(tangqianzhengming), 我也可以!
 谁要游戏人生，他就一事无成；谁不能主宰自己，永远是一个奴隶。---歌德
黑暗的死寂, 赞美生命. Respect and Reverence for life and Natural World. 摆脱自己对性与神性的虚伪.


# Gratification
All we are doing is gratification, even through boring things or nothing.
Did you ask yourself on why you do some specifical things without special intention?
Reward: some reward must be paid in a healthy way. Physiological needs: relax, food, water, sex, etc.
In my colleague life, I learned very hard with a strong specific motivation. But now, I have a motivation. But not do it as my colleague.
No passion? No reward! Why? masturbation.
If you did it, you finnally got the following word.
Retrocausality.
It's amazing that we know them before we got them. It's not the nutural progressing way in some degrees.
* Zland: Physiological needs: food, water, air, sex;Respect and fulfill my feelings.
安静而有节制的生活能比始终在不安困扰下追求成功带来更多的喜悦 --Einstein
A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness
* Showing-off: in front of interviewer
kzenowalker: feeling/desire; 
I have a inclination on wasting time. So must enforce what I do.
谷歌表示，该中心将在北京拥有一个专家团队，谷歌已在北京有数百名从事研发和其他工作的员工。谷歌AI中国中心将由李飞飞和李佳领导。李飞飞是斯坦福大学人工智能实验室的负责人，领导着谷歌云业务的人工智能部门；李佳是谷歌云业务的人工智能部门研发主管。
* Vicariousness 
It is harm for learning knowledge. I have a inclination on using vicarious method.
It brings: quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
Learning by doing will make you learn lots practical knowledge.
I found some bad effects of sujective vicarious mind:
Deceptive objectivity. The worst case is it make you deem that unstanding is equivalent to doing. 以为看懂kernel, 就能做了
Reading kernel book is looking the output of others's minds. It's something like 'flash across'. So it's fake of objectivity. That's why I read kernel book. Reading is ok because of we are Tabula rasa.
Overconfident subjective understanding. -- on larning kernel
Deceptive understanding, wrong and absent(not excessive abstraction). 
shirk hardship, seek comfort and enjoyment.
Neglect objectivities. 现实要比主观复杂多了.
Subjective paralysis;Easy to perform and achieve in subjectivity makes objectivity lose interest.
* Unknown and unawear are another big barrier for me to achive what I want.
Know how to solve every problem that has been solved. -- Feynman
People cannot see something wihout being denominated
不带有色眼光的, 看待事情知识本身. 别说什么你不感兴趣, 有些内容与计算机无关. 这都容易, 造成认知对象的消失, 从而偏见与盲目.
* emotional, conscious, desire:
Avoid the boring brought by being conscious on doing same things.
stimulation and thrill
Joy:laugher
Sympathy:vicarious, virtualization.
* Willpower: An idea is likes a seed; once planted in a person's mind, it's growth is determined by how well it is nourished. Without lasting relevance it might wither and die or become ousted by other ideas that occupy a larger space in the mindspace of the host. Some ideas though, once planted, strike roots and grow from a captivating notion into a fundamental ideology that overshadows and influences every thought that blossoms in it's wake." -- Homo Ludens or: Kojima's Evolution of Mankind (Death Stranding), RagnarRox
I don't want to be a natural roamer.
大部分的学习无效是因为没有强制性输出结果的压力.
If one thing is a must, do it now.
* Our minds is always fickle, unstable, vacillating. Sometimes the important side  is that our minds is partial, biased, unreliable. We cannot rely on it.
* Auto extend
# The architect and understructure
* Watch out vicariousnees!!
We don't have to remember/understand the things contrived by people. What we need to remember is the fact which leads this contriving!
精通围棋规则和精通围棋.
从实际应用场景出发, 而不是代码片段.
在计算机领域，很多人喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则殆，就是这个道理。书籍让你记住了现成的“事实”，却不能让你拥有产生出这些知识的能力。 -- Wangyin
它们只是把你“训练”（train）成了循规蹈矩的流水线工人，而不能让你受到真正的“教育”（education）。真正的好书都是很薄的，“把厚书读薄”这句话其实是误导的。厚书本来就不应该拿来读，最多可以拿来当字典查。所以我的建议是：如果你想成为天才，就避免去读厚书。去寻找简短的书来入门，然后就可以自己思考了。这就是我从 Nash 的故事得到的启发。 Wangyin
"除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应。 -- N Why I Am So Clever  Section8
叔本华思想随笔: 论思考
Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, other-
wise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read
nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done
myself!—That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute
beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is
what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it
spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s
periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at
Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what
this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The
other kind simply followed on from this.
* Sorcerer

避免陷入大量细节,不要求大求全.
不要被知识迷惑,  declarative knowledge 和 Procedural knowledge不能互相取代. 每种知识的关注点是不同的, 也就是逻辑链不同, 虽然看似学得是同样的内容, 实质上, 本后的逻辑完全不同.
熟练读, 初级与大魔导使.
* I have never thought about questions that are not real ones—I have not squandered myself. -- N
What shouldn't we learn? 我不是要了解一个语言or设计的实现细节. 这毫无必要, 仅仅在记忆而已.
通过事物的本质属性去理解他, 如fluent python Figure 2-1. page 20. 而核心是"用"这个真正意图, 正如正本fluent python.
python的语言的存在是一种临时的纽带关系. 一旦确定用的场景, 语言本身迅速消失, 留下用的样子.
所以什么改学呢? 用本质理解事物, 以及事物的用处. 并不关心事物本身, 隐去它.
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.
[知识的“局限性”][1] 碎片化的知识无用, 碎片化知识切割人生.
[知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。][2] 区分无用的知识.
Doing right things:effectiveness
* Learning by doing
New Pragmatism: 实践不应是被动的, 在做过才能验证. 而应该是主动的在, 在行动之前, 就以pragmatism为基础. 从美国回来的感受, 之前学英语, 很多内容不切实际.应该学一些能用到的.pragmatism不应只是一种验证, 更应该是一种指导.experience首要, 原则推理次之.强调,做事的应以, 实践为指导和决定, 而不是主观的意愿.
从日常的经历中和自然的理性中得到指导, daily experince, 收集日常的问题.
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 --Goethe
Reflexicity -- Soros/Statistics-based method training. -- Firo
从动手中学习（learn by doing）by Wang Yin;如果你看过 John Nash 的传记《A Beautiful Mind》，就会发现他与其他人的不同。Nash 看书只看封面和开头，把这书要讲的问题了解清楚之后，就自己动手解决。最后，他完全依靠自己的“头脑暴力”创造出整本书的内容。Nash 头脑里的数学知识，绝大部分是他自己造出来的，而不是看书看会的。也就是说，他把整个的研究领域作为一道道的练习题，用这种方式独立创造出了大部分的现代数学！Learn by doing, 这就是天才最重要的特征。
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability][3]
Never control by descriptions which are completely divorced from reality.
We will be captivated by the objectivities/doings, can't find the orign of world. (K2: 以为看过kernel绝大多数实现,样子就理解了kernel, 那只是更长的Feynman所说的名字, 是cramming)
Zur Sach selbst! ... to the things themselves!-- Husserl, Wittgenstein
[take the programs, modify them and enhance them.][7]  -- Stevens
Instant spectrum learning in doing.
The sadness of who is not an expriencer.
From all points, 森罗万象. 
Get the problem from relation/action
Pure full objects then scalability relations and problems. Firstly, understanding the objects. Then, you get different understandings from different perspective of objects.
这根不是计划!计划制定原则SMART, 不要盲目盲目相信理性, 纯粹理性批判, 不能主观, 审视理性的缺陷, 通过exprience, 实验, 验证来制定计划.
* Use Feynman and [Descartes's methods][6]
No book, only questions!
叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔 
inspecting and examining the problem will help us to get the right method, not defrauded by the subjectivity.

* Using affirmative and negative perspects to understand things.
* The origin of the world./structuralism?

# Steps based on unreal  experience
1. From all points, 森罗万象. 正反. 实用主义. 确定最小问题/cause,hands-on, 经验,经历, 集 and 最小必备知识集. 应该以experience为主, 至于理性层面是, 过程中思考得出. 所以前期, 我们可以不管, 理性上的结构. 从经验, 实验开始. 确保我们的知识,经验,现实是保持一致的, 同时不会陷入理性思维的深渊.
2. Find the root problems. It's the cause. Then Feynman and Descartes's methods. 实质上, 找到root cause, 我们已经完成了绝大多数事情, 剩下的就是使用方法, 来完成认知就ok.这点很重要!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2.1 如何找到root cause.
2.1.1 如何做到从问题到知识。依据现实实验经验自己设计思考 + 逻辑连贯. + 逻辑验证. 那些隐藏在巨大复杂度之下的知识了解他们有什么意义？  只有从理性生长出来才有意义.
2.1.1.1 我们应该从别人哪里得到是 术语名字, 而不是知识.
2.1.2 理性的使用, 理性更适合线性分析. 只允许理性在涉及阶段, 一个理性对待多个root cause.
2.1.3 实验6.5/10; 坚决反对在复杂的事物中不断搜索root cause, 反对用复杂实现去反推root cause，a. 时间长，无用，无法联系既有的知识，知识孤岛，这就是填鸭！b. 无法成长，从问题出发是解决问题，依前所述只是掩盖在复杂度之下的填鸭.

3. SMART a plan 
 
# Steps in doing
1. Instant spectrum learning in doing.

# The origins of the world
* Causality is abyss. Watch out origins.[Causal reasoning][8]
* Don't Expect Too Much.There is no perfect.Troubles come one by one. It will disapoint you finally.
* Nothing new under the sun.
* 知识是分逻辑依赖的 dependent ,轻重 缓急.
* 个人存在于因果律中, 同时也创建因果.
Causality order  quantities change relation
dependency, direction
Scalable
Cthulhu, unkonw world, hard to measure, unfalsifiable, unreality, unfathomable, Indeterminacy, unmeasurable, imponderable,indefinite, 
Repeat, irregularity, complexity

Completeness, consistency, validity, soundness. -- Logic
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology
