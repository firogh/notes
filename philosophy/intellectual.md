# Philosophy
Most General and comprehensive type of inquiry(what is true and why)
Epistemology is theory of knowledge.
Metaphysics is the theory of reality.
Epistemic realism: the view that our knowledge is true of its objects independent of our ideas, theories, and cultures.
Antirealism/relativism: our true knowledge is made true not byobjects independent of us, but by our own ideas, perspectives, theories, and cultures.
Analytic philosophy:
Continental philosophy:
Pragmatism:
Tempered view:
Scholasticism: philosophy of the schools was based Aristotle's logic and metaphysics; is essentially aristotle plus Christianity
Scholastic: what they did no have in their religious thouht was an elaborate complex theory of nature in the natural world.
Primary being/substance/the underlying:physical objects; contains parts but is not a pat of anything;properties are predicated of it, but it is not predicated of any thing.
Doctrine of the four causes: Aristotle generalize ideal objects, atomism to a very famous doctrine: the material, the efficient, the formal, the final.
Soul: the animating principle, not the Christian notion of soul, not an eternal ongoing non-physical essence.
Aristotle's three levels of soul: 1 vegetative soul, characteristic of plants. 2. Moving-senstive-passionate soul, characteristic of animals. 3. rational soul, charteristic of .
CGN: the only way to udnerstand these objects in this world is to turn away from your experience of them, form how they look day to day and instead pay attention to an ideal mathematical reconstruction of those objects.
Rape of the senses: Morden science does not accord with our unaided senses, it accords with mathematical theory of potentially unobservable entities that explain our sense experience in the other words the new platonic but experimental science replaced the Aristotelian quanlitative and purpose of science that have become integrated whith Christian thought

# Descartes
Archimedean point for all knowledge
Cogito ergo sum: I think, therefore I exist.
I: non-physical, thinking subsatnce.
extened substance/spatial extension
solipsist:
God must exists.
For Descartes, Reality is composed of:finite material substatnces, the essence of which is to take up space; finite mental substances, hunman minds and the human soul;on infinite mental substance, God.
Minds are non spatial thinking things without parts.Something without parts cannot come apart it can not decay. Imortal soul.
Descartes has thus provided a means a powerfull means of separating physical material reality which will noew be the province of the new science the materialist mechanical science of nature that comes especially from Galileo. The mind which is also the soul the seat of emotions which is also the seat of my own free will and hence responsible for ethics. It belongs to these fields and can't be studied by science.
The best cognitive method God has given us we must be right otherwise God just is a deceiver.
The field of evidence presented to my individual mind is the foundation of all evidence for any claim.
Foundationalism: the belief that philosophy's job jis to discover the foudndation or ground of all realist, objective knowledge.

# John Locke
An essay concerning human understanding(1690)
an empty cabinet/a blank slate
Locke's basic categories(all possible properties that anything in the world can have): extension, solidity, motivity, mobility, perceptivity ot thinking, existence, duration, number.
Primary qualities: in the subject(in my mind) and in the object size, volume, mass, velocity, number.
Secondary qualities : color, taste, sound
Knowledge: awareness of the agreement or disagreement of ideas with one another.
The awareness or knowledge comes in three different forms.
Intuition: the immediate recognition of the likenees or unlikeness of two ideas.
Senastion: feeling the entrance of ideas from sensation entering the mind.
Logical demostration or argument: Linking ideas together in such a way that there is a relationship of logical entailment or deduction.
 Unknown support.
Locke's method: a posteriori; based on facts about the world.
Descartes's method: could not use a posteriori agruments because he had doubted the existence of the world.

# Berkeley
Idealism: Reality is in some sense mental or the product of mind.
Interactions of mind and body:1. material events must be able to cause bodily and neural brain events. 2. Ideas in the mind must be able to represent things in the world that caused them; otherwise we couldn't have knowledge.
Ideas cannot represent material objects.
Locke's Primary quailites: ideas in the mind taht represet and resemble the same quality in the material object, like zie
Locke's secondary qualities: caused by material events but don't resemble them, like color.
Locke and Descartes: we perceive representations(ideas of things) outside our mind - representationalism
Berkeley: Where do representations exist? in our mind.
To be is to be percived.
Direct realism, the claim that we experience objects independent of the independent of the mind, is false.
Representationalism, the claim that we experience mental objects, but that these mental objects represent objects independent of the mind, is also false.
