# The being
The essence of this world is being. 
As the world changing, it become more complicated and diffcult to live within it.
I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to live in this world.
We use rational and sensous abilities to live within it.
# Imperfect being
I am not other beings.

# Analyzing
Break things down to first principles
## Successful cases analysis
environment, chance
what she/he did
## Antagonist analysis

## Self-analysis
*  Imperfect Understanding and radical fallibity are the natue of human.
collect and process information. 灯下寻针. 盲人摸象.
分析 推理. 路径依赖, 类比. first principle 有些时候应该用.
决策和行动. 优柔寡断, 纸上谈兵.
* What kind of environment are we in?
* we don't have their environment that is why we are not other beings partially.
2. unconfident because of lack of controling of other beings.
3. 厌恶痛苦、向往轻松快乐; Lazy and be clined to simple things
4. 贪婪, 贪多求全; craving for many and perfection; 主观上以自己刻苦努力来还取进步
* Subjective assume
Law of the hammer. 
People cannot see something wihout being denominated
## Task analysis
What does this task include?
What are the goals for this task
beginner to intermediate and advanced
What are the types of this task, model of thinking
e: procedual memory +, light reasoning structure
k: procedual memory, strong reasoning structure+
i:

# gradual doing
有些事是需要经年累月的练习
* quantatifications
Time per unit, Whole time ,doing size:
make it easay: From Humility to Perfect
Concurrent
## Sensous factors for learning
* 不要感动自己, 方法不对,再努力也没用. 
* the sense of achievement
进一寸有一寸的欢喜 -- Hu Shi
* Relax.让自己处在最佳状态.
* Showing-off: 
[装逼](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30178891/answer/205055193)谷歌表示，该中心将在北京拥有一个专家团队，谷歌已在北京有数百名从事研发和其他工作的员工。谷歌AI中国中心将由李飞飞和李佳领导。李飞飞是斯坦福大学人工智能实验室的负责人，领导着谷歌云业务的人工智能部门；李佳是谷歌云业务的人工智能部门研发主管。

# Feedback & Reflexcity 
## Learning by doing: 从动手中学习, 创造知识.
Watch out vicariousnees!!quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
Literal learner, 以为学习是纯粹的文字游戏, 没有把知识同实际生活关联, 死知识; 
事实　我们要实事求是，现在像贴贴标语，什么打倒田中义一等，都仅务虚名，像豆腐店里生意不好，看看“对我生财”泄闷一样。又像是以前的画符，一画符病就好的思想。贴了打倒帝国主义，帝国主义就真个打倒了么？这不对，我们应做切实的工作，奋力的做去。 -- Hu Shi
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 --Goethe
[Take the programs, modify them and enhance them.][7]  --Stevens
## Material for goals
* Life-relevant: 现学的不用,现用的不学 -- 金伟榕 https://www.zhihu.com/question/38206533
* working set, 有时可能需要简单的书来入门,然后就可以自己思考了.
* [知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。][2] 区分无用的知识.
* 有生命的活知识; fun and sense of achivement
* naive analysis:complicated? One-dimensional commensurable interaction and content structure and ingredient;Deductive reasoning;
* common tools: neo Descartes' method(onc...), Causality, Occam's razor 
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones - I have not squandered myself. -- N
## spectrum of feedback
* effecttiveness, 做有效的事而不是比努力做效果小的事
* Initiative 80%
authentic, artficial, uninvolved fact
native speaker, personal writing (including comparing), bilingual, listening, reading, none
* Biology [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruhe-xuexi#syllabus)
skill specific, Muscle Memory, Procedural Memory/ability, rote learning
* accuracy and error/ loss function
all posibilities, specified posibilities, x is unlimited and y is not sure
English:native speaker, bilingual material(book, news), comparing writings with examples, query google or books 
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.
* goal coverage
native speaker, query, comparing, bilingual
* Response Time/effciency?
realtime, delay, no
# Thinking and creating(and 分析综合) before every thing
拒绝填鸭,cramming, rote
不要成为跑马场, 叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔. 
[What did Richard Feynman mean when he said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand"?][4]
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
# Common Simplicity Methods for mastering complex world
* Occam's razor 
* Model of thinking
[Linus Torvalds talking with Aalto University students 11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDEce3mtkRg)
Math: numberic, concepts
* Neo [Descartes's methods][6]
Onset, nucleus, coda
Positive and negtive
MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive).
* Leave a question open 
* Abstraction
* Causality [Causal reasoning][8]
* critical thinking
* Reflexicity -- Soros
* Feynman method
![his blackboard at the time of death](http://archives.caltech.edu/pictures/1.10-29.jpg)
* World of origins
* Experiment
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability][3]

## Cases
a) What I learned from learning English and Kernel
做事情, 方法不对, 越努力越悲惨. 只有努力绝对不会成功, 相反会很悲惨.努力人人可以, 世界也不缺少努力的人.
* Fan shuangshuang network stack, kernel, and English
Broke the Law because of overconfident subjective understanding and memory ability.(Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications)
* Learn kernel and this country and world 
我之前喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则罔, 书籍让我记住了现成的“事实”，却没有给我产生出这些知识的能力.
除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应.--Why I Am So Clever  Section8
imperfect being: 1 & 2
* English
目标不清楚, 目标模糊没有量化; 方法也没有量化. Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications
Unconfident.
# knowledge forms
[布卢姆认知目标分类修订的二维框架](http://old.pep.com.cn/rjqk/kcjcjf/200409/201101/t20110106_1010047.htm)
存在即合理，无视甚至鄙视这些存在于人性、系统之中的“潜规则”，才是大大的不合理。
JIT e.g. kindle narrtion, soramimi
whole is not a pile of parts; ab != a + b
Abstruction:
Knowledge: base the analysis on life(using)
Qunataty: great large number => Working set, JIT, Knowledge >> life: Infinitive dissipation
Complexicty/granularity: centric high/large => abstaction, causality
Complexicty/granularity: well-distributed, low/small => practice
Causality or practice
Material: Character, sound
Working set:
onset-nucleus pair: yes for kernel 
procedure or descriptive knowledge bias: English and kernel are both procedure knowledge
* 死知识, Life-relevant: learn in real-life, no dead knowledge
[What is science by Feyman][5], do you know brown-throated thrush?
[知识的“局限性”][1] 碎片化的知识无用, 碎片化知识切割人生.
