Matter, space, Enegy, force, Time, Motion, The invisiable world and desymbolize. Conflicts. Problems world. 
## Causality
[Aristotle:we don't have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)
[Richard Feynman. Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA)
## Chaos
don’t try to make it logical
## Time
It’s easier to invent future than to predict it. — Alan Kay
Strategy is the art of making use of time and space. I am less chary of the latter than the former. Space we can recover, lost time never. —Napoleon Bonaparte
### Timeline, history
## Complexcity
No silver bullet. The Mythical Man-Month, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, The philosophy of software design
### Detail complexcity and dynamic complexcity - chapter 20 Rewriting the Code of The Fifith discipline.
### Code complete 2
In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.
... Dijkstra pointed out that no one’s skull is really big enough to contain a modern computer program (Dijkstra 1972 The Humble Programmer), which means that we as software developers shouldn’t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you to keep in the air at once, the more likely you’ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design or coding error.
## Structure
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology
### Model of thinking - [Linus Torvalds talking with Aalto University students 11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDEce3mtkRg)
### Fern, Chaos theory
## The other

# Life
Physical(including Biology) and mental world; subjective building and role based knowledge vs Subjectivity. In-thing vs Out-observing. Protection and Tidy; top-down vs bottom-up; de-symblize smantic and express yourself; mental arbitrariness vs physical concidence; relative knowledge and relative essence. 
## Independence
什么是独立呢?“独立”是你们自己的事，给你自由而不独立这是奴隶，独立要不盲从，不受欺骗，不依傍门户，不依赖别人，不用别人耳朵为耳朵，不以别人的脑子为脑子，不用别人的眼睛为眼睛，这就是独立的精神。 -- 胡适在北京大学1946年开学演讲
The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgement should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge. -on education, Albert Einstein
If you don't control yourself, you will be controlled by the Other. In turn, you lose yourself. - Firo
## Mental abilities
John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding: The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining ideas [...] 2. [..] it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.
Abstraction and concrete. [由為什麼 “abstraction”不應該譯為“抽象化”談正名](https://link.medium.com/TqmKU622u1) and [Generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization) 
## Energy and Life expectancy
One of the conditions for reading what is good is that we must not read what is bad; for life is short and time and energy are limited. - Schopenhauver on reading and books

# Knowledge
活知识; the ability of Swim and learning of history; Define the question, restore to life and causlaity; Architecture: common causes for many effects. Just for fun.
## Relative knowledge
Focus on how well we understand this world; don't pursue a objective knowledge of this world.
Role-based understanding.

# Will - cause, goals, Plan, project.
Do what you really want to do. If you want to do something, but you are afraid to do it, then that is likely what you should do.

# Actual problems  
Language must be restored to real life. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones - I have not squandered myself. -- N

put things in causlity not in mind.
[Why I Don’t Use A Smart Phone | Ann Makosinski | TEDxTeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjaM0tdxtYA)

# Small and simplicity
gradually grow up a little bit each day. 
记少不记多,反而记更多; 时间是否充裕,都先记少. So I saw the less is more in action: the more studies, the less obvious elementary but fundamental things become; activity, on the other hand, strips things to their simplest possible model. -- Antifragile, Nassim. First, we can do it. Second, less will make more because we know the foundations before other things. 基础的简单的事.

Leave questions open: There are always some knowledge which is too complicated to understand and we should leave them alone.
Pragmatism

# Observability - Have fun.
## Metric
Firo: There are many levels of creation, e.g. a blank piece of paper.

# Feedback and mistakes
Delay -- The fifth discipline

# End of times of analyzing. End of lack causes and processes of mine.End of static frozen fixed whole knowledge via Logical Positivism.
Dynamic knowledge; Reflexivity
大部分人从学校，从书籍，从文献学知识，结果学到一堆“死知识”。要检验知识是不是死的，很简单。如果你遇到前所未见的问题，却不能把这些知识运用出来解决问题，那么这些知识就很可能是死的。 -- wangyin

# Meaning 
直觉,图形. 在意不在形, sensemaking
Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**; and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.** ... Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.** - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII

# First principle, then minimum essential fundamentals. 
“I tend to approach things from a physics framework,” Musk said in an interview. “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.” - Elon Musk

# Learning by doing/creating - what you did defines you. reinvent, creating, using.
![one of Hushi's effort](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AbCS5qgAg1_ak7viwlE-g10z_8PmW1Hu/view?usp=sharing)
[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Leonardo_da_Vinci): I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.
Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics: For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.
Feynman mean: [What I cannot create, I do not understand?](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand)
Goethe: 我们必须流下热汗, 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产.
Ray Dalio: knowing how to deal well with you setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward.
John Dewey: [D is for John Dewey: His Approach To Education](https://www.thepositiveencourager.global/john-deweys-approach-to-doing-positive-work/)
Montaigne: We take other men’s knowledge and opinions upon trust; which is an idle and superficial learning. We must make them our own. We are just like a man who, needing fire, went to a neighbor’s house to fetch it, and finding a very good one there, sat down to warm himself without remembering to carry any back home. What good does it do us to have our belly full of meat if it is not digested, if it is not transformed into us, if it does not nourish and support us?
[Stop Thinking and Start Doing: The Power of Practicing More](https://jamesclear.com/learning-vs-practicing)
[Why Should We Learn By Doing?](http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-224-pg.html)
## Purpose practice
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html)
Thomas Sterner, The Practicing Mind: When we practice something, we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal. The words deliberate and intention are key here because they define the difference between actively practicing something and passively learning it.

# Think for yourself[TFY](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Thinking_for_Oneself)
[Get your brain back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcdxW2XF0v8)
Schopenhauver: From all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints in the sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he saw on the way, one requires his eyes.
Wang Yin: 观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清.
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak(Firo: also the dawn of day) or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. -- Ecce Homo Nietzsche, Why I write such good books, Review of Human, All Too Human section 4.(Firo: search bookwormery)
And [The Dawn of Day](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39955/39955-h/39955-h.html#toc1) and [The wanderer and his shadow](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37841/37841-h/37841-h.html#toc7)
If he does not skim, he does not think. - Ecce Homo Friedrich Nietzsche, Why I Am So Clever, section 8

# Human actions and practices pattern
## action and practice structure
Invariants: search goals and problems, goals, problems, actions, solutions
Material
Q = ( TfO * relevance(main root) * growing(past vs present structre, now structre) * Expanse ) / ( translation * Trivia * Irrelevancy)
## problems
Everyone can solve problems.Problems could be functionalties or goals.Problems could be optimizations which are better expressions of above functionalites or goals.Problems are structures(practices or actions?). Problems are growing upon others. Problems are growing structures.
## Differences between reading kernel source code and kernel programming
creator/kernel hacking: 1. find problems; 2. problems; 3. create solutions 4. solutions
reader/reading codes: 1. translate(easy but less efficient way, reverse actions of creator) observings to problems

# Mistakes
## 海边度假问题
## Symbols
problems: last node of linked list when iterating. problems from actions. don't be fooled by symbols. linked list not "simple".
[Feynman: Name of something vs something](Richard Feynman - Names Don't Constitute Knowledge)
Collecting huge symbols without meaning is completely wasting time and life.
Symbols Authoritarianism
## High Cost doesn't mean high efficiency
## Subjectivity
Different minds; different behavoir; Relative minds. Writers are different to you. They don't know wht you really want.
Vicariousness, Illusion of Competence
## Subjetive and relative knowlodgy Theory
## Books
Schopenhauver on reading and books:We can never read the bad too little and the good too often.Inferior books are intellectual poison; they ruin the mind.
## In-thing and out-observing
The creators are different to you, too. You are not only lack of what they created, but also ablities they used to create things. Unerstand vs create.
[Knowledge by Acquaintance vs. Description](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-acquaindescrip/#Dis)
return to myself vs made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (which is what reading is!) -- Ecce Homo
nature grow, creation direction vs string search, artificial translation direction
vs 只有接受, 没有思维锻炼的机会.
process to 'see'/experience vs symbols only
dependent knowledge, the underlying vs superfical knowledge
vs name of something, symbols
vs foreign to the drift and temper
causality vs reverse causalaity
vs 纸上得来终觉浅。 observation limited by symbols, named only.
Focus energy on goals. vs the wanderer, unlimited scope vague goals
