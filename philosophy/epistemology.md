# The being
The essence of this world is being. 
As the world changing, it become more complicated and diffcult to live within it.
I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to live in this world.
We use rational and sensous abilities to live within it.
# Neutral being
* Being apppears in interaction. Learn in doing.
# Imperfect being
0. I am not other beings.
* we are inclinded not to being other beings. 
That's why I was reading kernel book not writing some codes during learning kernel. Same to english. It's the lowest change of myself. It's easy.
* we don't have their environment that is why we are not other beings partially.
1. didn't find the precious of self-thinking and doing.(maybe first principle)
2. unconfident because of lack of controling of other beings.
3. 厌恶痛苦、向往轻松快乐; Lazy and be clined to simple things
## The drawbacks of human's reasoning;  Imperfect Understanding and radical fallibity are the natue of human.
1. collect and process information. 灯下寻针. 盲人摸象.
2. 分析 推理. 路径依赖, 类比. first principle 有些时候应该用.
3. 决策和行动. 优柔寡断, 纸上谈兵.
4. 存在即合理，无视甚至鄙视这些存在于人性、系统之中的“潜规则”，才是大大的不合理。
* Subjective assume
Law of the hammer. 
People cannot see something wihout being denominated
* Lack of quantatifications
* Break the Law
Watch out vicariousnees!!quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
Literal learner, 以为学习是纯粹的文字游戏, 没有把知识同实际生活关联, 死知识; 
## Cases
* Fan shuangshuang network stack, kernel, and English
Broke the Law because of overconfident subjective understanding and memory ability.(Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications)
* Learn kernel and this country and world 
我之前喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则罔, 书籍让我记住了现成的“事实”，却没有给我产生出这些知识的能力.
除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应.--Why I Am So Clever  Section8
imperfect being: 1 & 2
* English
目标不清楚, 目标模糊没有量化; 方法也没有量化. Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications
Unconfident.
# Law of Human learning
## Thinking and creating(and 分析综合) before every thing and First principles
## Imperfect methods

# Thinking and creating(and 分析综合) before every thing and First principles
拒绝填鸭,cramming, rote
不要成为跑马场, 叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔. 
[What did Richard Feynman mean when he said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand"?][4]
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!—That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations

# Imperfect methods
S3G
## Sensous factors for learning
## the generating method of quantified clear goals, self appraisal and evnironment
## the generating method of quantified gradual feedback doing

# the generating method of quantified clear goals, self appraisal and evnironment
## Clear Goals
List goals
### What content do we need to learn first for these goals? Especially for a large amount of complicated information
* Life-relevant: 现学的不用，现用的不学 -- 金伟榕 https://www.zhihu.com/question/38206533
* common tools: neo Descartes' method(onc...), Causality, Occam's razor 
* working set, 有时可能需要简单的书来入门,然后就可以自己思考了.
* 有生命的活知识; fun and sense of achivement
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones - I have not squandered myself. -- N
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.
[知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。][2] 区分无用的知识.
###  goals and contents level
* Humble beginner to intermediate and advanced
## self appraisal
through doing and feedback
## environments analysis
authentic, uninvolved fact, and artificial
environment: questions/goal, feedbacks, gradual improvement, 
### the drawbacks of artificial environment
* questions/goal: discounted
* gradual improvement : not sustainable
* feedback
input feedback: a) limited realtime inputs; b) input content was limited to specifc small range. z)medium  feedback, 
output feedback:  a) don't know what to do; in fact, a little. b) the output results are barely verified. z) low feedback
io feedback: unknown
* sense of achievement: not sure

# the generating method of quantified gradual feedback doing
## gradual doing
procedual/declerative ability: innate learned things.
Procedural Memory and [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruhe-xuexi#syllabus)
* Understanding(prepare for doing).
* Doing: action, Output, rearrang, ...
事实　我们要实事求是，现在像贴贴标语，什么打倒田中义一等，都仅务虚名，像豆腐店里生意不好，看看“对我生财”泄闷一样。又像是以前的画符，一画符病就好的思想。贴了打倒帝国主义，帝国主义就真个打倒了么？这不对，我们应做切实的工作，奋力的做去。 -- Hu Shi
Learning by doing: 从动手中学习, 创造知识.
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 --Goethe
[Take the programs, modify them and enhance them.][7]  --Stevens
* Gradual improvement and longterm; iterative and incremental learning.
Time per unit;
Whole time 
doing size:
make it easay: From Humility to Perfect
Concurrent
## Feedback and Reflexcity 
Good examples feedback.
comparing my articles with others feedback.
google or books realtime feedback.

# Sensous factors for learning
Cue, routine, and reward is mandatory
* Showing-off: 
[装逼](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30178891/answer/205055193)谷歌表示，该中心将在北京拥有一个专家团队，谷歌已在北京有数百名从事研发和其他工作的员工。谷歌AI中国中心将由李飞飞和李佳领导。李飞飞是斯坦福大学人工智能实验室的负责人，领导着谷歌云业务的人工智能部门；李佳是谷歌云业务的人工智能部门研发主管。
* the sense of achievement
进一寸有一寸的欢喜 -- Hu Shi

# Common Simplicity Methods for mastering complex world
* Occam's razor 
* Neo [Descartes's methods][6]
Onset, nucleus, coda
Positive and negtive
MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive).
* Leave a question open 
* Abstraction
* Causality [Causal reasoning][8]
* critical thinking
* Reflexicity -- Soros
* Feynman method
![his blackboard at the time of death](http://archives.caltech.edu/pictures/1.10-29.jpg)
* World of origins
* Experiment
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability][3]

# understanding/doing and artficial/authentic environment and procedual/declerative ability
## Case study
[不能速成，说明你的学习方法错了！](http://www.xinli001.com/info/100367315)
* 练琴 
有明确目标, not complicated, high feedback and high sense of achivement.
* 哑巴英语
书本情景太少, 情景不是理论. 语法才是理论.
情景本身就是明确的问题, 具有feedback, 但无趣. 去美国就完美了.
* 营销
目标明确, 自己直接feedback, 金钱兴趣.
* 游戏理论
有前提.就是要速成, 很好.

# knowledge forms
JIT e.g. kindle narrtion, soramimi
whole is not a pile of parts; ab != a + b
Abstruction:
Knowledge: base the analysis on life(using)
Qunataty: great large number => Working set, JIT, Knowledge >> life: Infinitive dissipation
Complexicty/granularity: centric high/large => abstaction, causality
Complexicty/granularity: well-distributed, low/small => practice
Causality or practice
Material: Character, sound
Working set: 
onset-nucleus pair: yes for kernel 
procedure or descriptive knowledge bias: English and kernel are both procedure knowledge
* 死知识, Life-relevant: learn in real-life, no dead knowledge

[知识的“局限性”][1] 碎片化的知识无用, 碎片化知识切割人生.
