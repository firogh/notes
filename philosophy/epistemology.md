# Unknown
Causality, Reality, dynamic, Chaos, abyss, unknown, Thing-in-itself, Universal connection, Life, Uncertainty, Reality, Effect and Inefficiency, change/process, complexicity, Atifragile, the invisiable world
Matter, space, Enegy, force, Time, Motion, The invisiable world and desymbolize. Conflicts. Problems world.
## Causality
[Aristotle:we don't have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)
[Richard Feynman. Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA)
## Chaos
don’t try to make it logical
## Time
It’s easier to invent future than to predict it. — Alan Kay
Strategy is the art of making use of time and space. I am less chary of the latter than the former. Space we can recover, lost time never. —Napoleon Bonaparte
### Timeline, history
## Complexcity
No silver bullet. The Mythical Man-Month, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, The philosophy of software design
### Detail complexcity and dynamic complexcity - chapter 20 Rewriting the Code of The Fifith discipline.
### Code complete 2
In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.
... Dijkstra pointed out that no one’s skull is really big enough to contain a modern computer program (Dijkstra 1972 The Humble Programmer), which means that we as software developers shouldn’t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you to keep in the air at once, the more likely you’ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design or coding error.
## Structure
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology
### Model of thinking - [Linus Torvalds talking with Aalto University students 11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDEce3mtkRg)
### Fern, Chaos theory
## The other

# Life
Physical(including Biology) and mental world; subjective building and role based knowledge vs Subjectivity. In-thing vs Out-observing. Protection and Tidy; top-down vs bottom-up; de-symblize smantic and express yourself; mental arbitrariness vs physical concidence; relative knowledge and relative essence. 
## Independence
什么是独立呢?“独立”是你们自己的事，给你自由而不独立这是奴隶，独立要不盲从，不受欺骗，不依傍门户，不依赖别人，不用别人耳朵为耳朵，不以别人的脑子为脑子，不用别人的眼睛为眼睛，这就是独立的精神。 -- 胡适在北京大学1946年开学演讲
The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgement should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge. -on education, Albert Einstein
If you don't control yourself, you will be controlled by the Other. In turn, you lose yourself. - Firo
## Mental abilities
John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding: The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining ideas [...] 2. [..] it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.
Abstraction and concrete. [由為什麼 “abstraction”不應該譯為“抽象化”談正名](https://link.medium.com/TqmKU622u1) and [Generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization) 
## Energy and Life expectancy
One of the conditions for reading what is good is that we must not read what is bad; for life is short and time and energy are limited. - Schopenhauver on reading and books

# Knowledge
活知识, 死知识:https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2019/07/12/learning-philosophy -- wangyin
the ability of Swim and learning of history; Define the question, restore to life and causlaity; Architecture: common causes for many effects. Just for fun.
## Relative knowledge
Focus on how well we understand this world; don't pursue a objective knowledge of this world.
Role-based understanding.

# Observability - Have fun.
## Metric

# Meaning 
直觉, 图形. 在意不在形, sensemaking.

# Unknown
	 Time:	 coward, timebound
Unknown:	 Plan, goal, grow by mistakes, feedback
		 Actual problems and actions
		 Raw(high level, mode, complete)
	 Method: Meaning: 在意不在形, sensemaking not analyzing, constructivism, root cause, First principles
		 Small
		 Bawan

		 最初的悸动
		 stupor, sea beach vacation
unknown, actual problems, plan, grow by actual mistakes, sensemaking

# Will
Do what you really want to do. If you want to do something, but you are afraid to do it, then that is likely what you should do.
[Don’t be a pussy](https://cirosantilli.com/#dont-be-a-pussy). 
不是有希望才做, 是做了才有希望. -- twitter June 4.

# 2 cause-effects: 事情的因果与人的因果.
Montaigne: We take other men’s knowledge and opinions upon trust; which is an idle and superficial learning. We must make them our own. We are just like a man who, needing fire, went to a neighbor’s house to fetch it, and finding a very good one there, sat down to warm himself without remembering to carry any back home. What good does it do us to have our belly full of meat if it is not digested, if it is not transformed into us, if it does not nourish and support us?
## End of times of interperting. End of lack causes and processes of mine.End of static frozen fixed whole knowledge via Logical Positivism.
Dynamic knowledge; Reflexivity
大部分人从学校，从书籍，从文献学知识，结果学到一堆“死知识”。要检验知识是不是死的，很简单。如果你遇到前所未见的问题，却不能把这些知识运用出来解决问题，那么这些知识就很可能是死的。 -- wangyin
## 那人的因果呢？ arrange creating and vs interpreting
In-creating and out-observing interpreting
You are not only lack of what the creators created, but also the experiences which they go through and the abilities they get.
Acquire dependent knowledge, the underlying vs superfical knowledge
[Knowledge by Acquaintance vs. Description](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-acquaindescrip/#Dis)
vs 只有接受, 没有思维锻炼的机会.
meaning vs name of something, symbols
vs foreign to the drift and temper
纸上得来终觉浅 vs observation limited by symbols, named only.
Focus energy on goals. vs the wanderer, unlimited scope vague goals
### 补完计划
No pondering no gain.(Think for yourself). What you think what you get.
### [Think for yourself](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Thinking_for_Oneself)
Don't steal other's knowledge;不要思考结论，思考conditions。
Return to myself vs made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (which is what reading is!) -- Ecce Homo
Schopenhauver: From all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints in the sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he saw on the way, one requires his eyes.
Wang Yin: 观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清.
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak(Firo: also the dawn of day) or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. -- Ecce Homo Nietzsche, Why I write such good books, Review of Human, All Too Human section 4.(Firo: search bookwormery)
And [The Dawn of Day](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39955/39955-h/39955-h.html#toc1) and [The wanderer and his shadow](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37841/37841-h/37841-h.html#toc7)
If he does not skim, he does not think. - Ecce Homo Friedrich Nietzsche, Why I Am So Clever, section 8
### Learning by creating - what you did defines you.
Pioneer.
Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics: For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.
Feynman mean: [What I cannot create, I do not understand?](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand)
John Dewey:[D is for John Dewey: His Approach To Education](https://www.thepositiveencourager.global/john-deweys-approach-to-doing-positive-work/)
[Why Should We Learn By Doing?](http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-224-pg.html) The reason Learning by Doing works is that it strikes at the heart of the basic memory processes upon which humans rely. Human memory is based in scripts and the generalization of scripts...
#### Constructivism, sense-making theory, learn by creating

Firo: There are many levels of creation, e.g. a blank piece of paper.
### 经历困难的问题人才能成长. 越困难的问题, 对人的历练越多.
不要轻看那些初看自己想出来的简单的问题。 那个就是你思考的基础。
勇敢面多苦难，经历苦难吧。
苦难对于天才是垫脚石,对于强者是一笔财富,对于弱者是万丈深渊 --巴尔扎克
实际上，许多人缺乏内在的精神活力，常常被苦难摧毁。-- Rudolf Eucken 如何看待苦难造就人这种逻辑？zhihu.com/question/24526150/answer/35927869
### 正向思考: problems -> solutions, 解决问题, 而不是翻译猜谜。
Nature grow, creation direction vs string search, artificial translation, interpreting 
Numa_interleave: 不是自然的， 不要通过构成部分理解。 它是意志的体现。
不要思考结论，思考conditions。比如不要思考是否加锁，而是并发了怎么办？是否存在并发。反向递归,到根因, 之后从哪里思考，根据材料不同，需要多次反向递归。
### clarity of thought and exactness of definition
Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**; and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.** ... Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.** - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII

# 创造的材料
divide problems to small problems which could be solved.
## From Raw
有什么样的材料都可以.需要的材料,可以不断制作。

# Actual problems, reality
## Fake problems
Final cause: observabity is fake final; it's a set of final causes.
fake final: what is it used for. things could be used as various functionalites.
Language must be restored to real life. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones - I have not squandered myself. -- N
## specific conditions
## 不知道的问题怎么办？ or 不能直接遇到的问题？
不要在意某个特定的问题， 而是关注后面隐藏的对应的model， arrange 能力。
这并不是model设计的问题, 而是conditions的问题。不是忽略or遇不到问题， 而是没有conditions.
另外，关注的是arrange，没有遇到的问题也无所谓。所以基于当前conditions, 做最好设计就OK.
没有遇到的问题是更大问题的遗漏.
## 不要忽略那些你思考不出来的看似简单的问题
## 你思考不清楚的问题，说明有很多欠缺。

# Solutions
问题是确定的, 主要的, 方案可以随specific condition变化.
Don't rember the solutions, understand the problems.
## Problems, arrnage, solutions

# Goal
## The greats
理想世界, 牛人心态; 自己变厉害, 会遇见更厉害的人. The greats 法乎其上, 得乎其中,法乎其中,仅得其下

# Arrange
conditions, problems, goals, arrange, solutions.
## Mind
abstract, general, vague vs concrete and specific(SMART), plan
symbols vs meanings
time: Immediate
outside reality connections
attention: [Get your brain back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcdxW2XF0v8)

## Create it.
## Conditions
不是不能理解某个问题， 而是前提条件(or 问题)不知道.
Pioneer
think from zero/basis or read git log/human writings. DO NOT do abductive reasoning.
## Plan, timeline(timebound)
Goal, SMART, work backwards(what about skill-forward) and actionable steps, milestones, timeline

### Get up to speed with it.
List related contents. Allocate time for them.
Degree:final human ideas.
## Raw and easy
## Model and modules and casulities chains
Feynman meaning bird's name and Feynman technique: underlying logic, no symbols
Model: Human ideas.
Model: finite state machine
Model: Levitation; set of problems, conditions(object and relevant casualities) based thinking, prominent or outstanding, goals, and arranges, solutions; 
List possibilites.

### First principle, then minimum essential fundamentals.
“I tend to approach things from a physics framework,” Musk said in an interview. “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.” - Elon Musk
### Relative and revelant knowledge

## Divide to small problems gradually
So I saw the less is more in action: the more studies, the less obvious elementary but fundamental things become; activity, on the other hand, strips things to their simplest possible model. -- Antifragile, Nassim. First, we can do it. Second, less will make more because we know the foundations before other things.
Occam's razor and Descartes's methods: Main/primary causes and secondary causes, Essential causes and additional causes;
Complete: MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive).
## Simplize problems to be able to fix
## Grow by feedback and mistakes and failures

Delay -- The fifth discipline
Ray Dalio: knowing how to deal well with you setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward.
## Purpose practice
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html)
Thomas Sterner, The Practicing Mind: When we practice something, we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal. The words deliberate and intention are key here because they define the difference between actively practicing something and passively learning it.

# Mistakes
## 海边度假问题
## Meaning vs Symbols
LT: I haven't ever really found it useful to read other people's code for ideas - source code is a singularly bad medium for transferring high-level concepts, since the whole point is to tell a really stupid computer exactly what to do, rather than explain it at any human level.
problems: last node of linked list when iterating. problems from actions. don't be fooled by symbols. linked list not "simple".
[Feynman: Name of something vs something](Richard Feynman - Names Don't Constitute Knowledge)
Collecting huge symbols without meaning is completely wasting time and life.
Symbols Authoritarianism
## High Cost doesn't mean high efficiency
## Subjectivity
Different minds; different behavoir; Relative minds. Writers are different to you. They don't know wht you really want.
Vicariousness, Illusion of Competence
## Subjetive and relative knowlodgy Theory
## Books
Schopenhauver on reading and books:We can never read the bad too little and the good too often.Inferior books are intellectual poison; they ruin the mind.
