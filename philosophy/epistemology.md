# Causality
[Aristotle: we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)
[Richard Feynman. Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA)

# Will, the cause
休谟更是猛烈地攻击了传统理性主义，他在《人性论》中说：理性是感性(Firo: 非理性) 的奴隶，除了服务和服从感性之外，再也不能有任何其他的作用。他认为理性本身是不存在的，纯理性不足以产生任何行动和意志作用。一切理性推理都不过是一种感觉。不但在文学艺术中，就是在哲学和科学中，我们也得遵循我们的爱好和情趣。
## Non-concrete and Compplexcity and uncertanty could prevent us from procuring cause.
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones - I have not squandered myself. -- N
## If you don't control yourself, you will be controlled by others. In turn, you lose yourself.

# Time, History, future, being, death
It’s easier to invent future than to predict it. — Alan Kay
Denial of reliazation of death will lose control of time.

# Structure, form
Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**; and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.** ... Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.** - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology
## Model of thinking - [Linus Torvalds talking with Aalto University students 11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDEce3mtkRg)

# Complexcity
No silver bullet. The Mythical Man-Month, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, The philosophy of software design
## Detail complexcity and dynamic complexcity - chapter 20 Rewriting the Code of The Fifith discipline.
## Code complete 2
In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.
... Dijkstra pointed out that no one’s skull is really big enough to contain a modern computer program (Dijkstra 1972 The Humble Programmer), which means that we as software developers shouldn’t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you to keep in the air at once, the more likely you’ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design or coding error.

### Leave questions open
There are always some knowledge which is too complicated to understand and we should leave them alone.

# Mind
[由「為什麼 “abstraction”不應該譯為“抽象化”」談正名](https://link.medium.com/TqmKU622u1) and [Generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization)
## Mind the starter of causality
good order, expection, problem
## Lose/ cannot find cause due to complexcity and uncertanty. In turn, the effect is lost, too.
## Sharttered mind: don't think for yourself. You minds depends on input. If no input, you cannot think.
## Mind is restricted by how it is represented.
Stereoscopic Thinking
## Concrete gravity
## Subjectivity
## Different minds; different behavoir; Relative minds; 
Writers are different to you. They don't know wht you really want.
The creators are different to you, too. You are not only lack of what they created, but also ablities they used to create things. Unerstanding vs creation.
## Abyss - Losing the self. Colonized by others. Amusing ourselves to death. The Society of the Spectacle Kakurenbo; assimilated by language, reluctant to use new language.
## Mind abilities
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made. -- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

# Think for yourself
“记录在纸上的思想，不过是像在沙上行走者的足迹而已，我们也许能看到他所走过的路径；如果我们想要知道他在路上看见些什么，则必须用我们的眼睛” - Schopenhauer
观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清. -- Wang Yin
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
我们必须流下热汗, 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 -- Goethe
