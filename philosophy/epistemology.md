# The being
The essence of this world is being. 
As the world changing, it become more complicated and diffcult to live within it.
I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to live in this world.
We use rational and sensous abilities to live within it.
* Imperfect being. I am not other beings.

知识不是被创造, 而是被看见.
# the goals of learning 
1. master the abilities through practicing every day.
2. Recogize these abilities. Perphas, word of origin

# the learning model
1. recoginzeing the abilites
analyzing, Problem & ability, appriasing
2. Practice
## Implementions
### 1. Think for oneslef - Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII
Don't start from the pure conceptions, from the real basic problems.
Problems before conceptions.
Thoery often is after the practices.
Commonly, problems often hide in the history.
#### Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, 
so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth
much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over.
#### The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**;
1. and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity
between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to
the other.
2. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as
foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at
the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its
stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to
think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has
absolutely no inclination or disposition.**
...
Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a
spring when a weight is continually applied to it;
This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple
than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers
of every success.**
3. “记录在纸上的思想，不过是像在沙上行走者的足迹而已，我们也许能看到他所走过的路径；如果我们想要知道他在路上看见些什么，则必须用我们的眼睛”
##### monitor the status of inclination and disposition of every knowledge I am learning.
#### Repeat
“复习是学习之母。”每一本重要的书籍都必须一气呵成连续读上两
遍。原因之一是在阅读第二遍的时候,我们会更好地理解书中内容的整体
关联,而只有知道了书的结尾才会明白书的开头;原因之二就是在第二次
阅读的时候,我们的心境、情绪与在第一次阅读时已经有所不同。这样,
我们获得的印象也会不一样。情形就好比在不同光线之下审视同一样的物

# Feedback & Reflexcity 
## Learning by doing: 从动手中学习, 创造知识.
* 模糊的自我
事实上, 外界总是清晰,完整的. 而我们自己是模糊的. 即便, 我们清楚的了解了外界, 依然对自己还是模糊的. 每个人都不一样, 有的优秀而更多的差一些.
但如何知道自己呢? 每个人都可以清楚理解外界, 但人和人的差距呢? 人如何不同?怎么知道自己差在哪? 不知道差在哪, 如何feedback成长呢?
我们并不是对这个世界一无所知, 很多时候, 我们只是某些地方不行, 还有很多地方我们可以. 因为躬行是耗费大量经历的, 我们不可能在短暂的一生中了解所有, 而且
也永不上.
* 自己并不是光滑的表面
每个人的成长经历都不一样, 这也导致了人在同一个方面, 能力的不同, 有的好, 有的差. 我们都有能力去做事,能力好的就更熟练, 差的就补上. 
做了才知道, 自己行不行, 看懂了每个人都行. 所以, 学习是每个人都独特的事情, 绝不是千篇一律的. 有的地方快, 有的地方慢.
* 成长应扎根于自己的实际情况
而不是, 瀑布式的过一遍, 或者是使用'抽象理解方法(world origin和causality)', 对事物进行清晰的认知. 都不能完美的切合我们自身的情况, 绝大多数情况下, 这些方法完全与我们自身契合, 就行白纸包在齿轮上, 轻风拂过山岗, 除了小草和树职业动一动, 没有留下什么. 因为, 这并没有补足我们的缺陷.
很多时候, 我们的不足, 往往是很藏的深, 根植与长久的过往经历, 很难简单的通过理解下就不上来. 不存在轻松简单的方法. 
差的多的就该多练, 而不是之上谈兵, 简单过去了.  活在幻觉中. 人是如此的复杂, 以至于我们自己都看不清自己.
skill specific practics
* 抽象的理解应该是建立在大量基础练习之上, 而得出.
而不仅仅, 基于理论的抽象逻辑得出, 那是空中楼阁.  更不应花太多时间在这个上. 这回给人一种错觉, 以为自己都了解, 实际上自己连简单的算法都写不出来.
这也是一种vicariousness. 直接结果就是眼高手低. 相比能写出binary tree, 理解清楚有什么用?分文不值.

Watch out vicariousness!!quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
Literal learner, 以为学习是纯粹的文字游戏, 没有把知识同实际生活关联, 死知识; 
事实　我们要实事求是，现在像贴贴标语，什么打倒田中义一等，都仅务虚名，像豆腐店里生意不好，看看“对我生财”泄闷一样。又像是以前的画符，一画符病就好的思想。贴了打倒帝国主义，帝国主义就真个打倒了么？这不对，我们应做切实的工作，奋力的做去。 -- Hu Shi

# Thinking and creating(and 分析综合) before every thing
拒绝填鸭,cramming, rote
不要成为跑马场, 叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔. 
[What did Richard Feynman mean when he said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand"?][4]
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
* quality of this thinking.
## what should you do?
* 理性思维做理性思维的事情, 不要浪费宝贵的理性思维去常识记忆细节.
人的理性记忆是有限的，记不了那么多，经验上一个人记忆应在算法范围之内， 超出没意义。浪费时间，白做工。理性应该主攻implicit memory极难处理的世界之源通用化.
* 细节不属于理解, 细节属于procedural memory, implicit memory
* leave questions open
make sure what are not important and try to avoid or escape them.
我们其实更想得到的是如何促成哪些细节, 这是一种能力. 而不是, 简简单单知道某个细节, 这仅仅是个fact.
而我们的时间精力是有限的, 我们集中我们的精力 最重要的事, 而不是对什么都是flat的. 
* What is important?
自己真实doing:自己的理解总有误区, 极限.
其他人经验: 我们要依靠别人的经验, 但别人也是有误区的, 这无法避免.

## Cases
a) What I learned from learning English and Kernel
做事情, 方法不对, 越努力越悲惨. 只有努力绝对不会成功, 相反会很悲惨.努力人人可以, 世界也不缺少努力的人.
* Fan shuangshuang network stack, kernel, and English
Broke the Law because of overconfident subjective understanding and memory ability.(Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications)
* Learn kernel and this country and world
我之前喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则罔, 书籍让我记住了现成的“事实”，却没有给我产生出这些知识的能力.
除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应.--Why I Am So Clever  Section8
imperfect being: 1 & 2
* English
目标不清楚, 目标模糊没有量化; 方法也没有量化. Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications
Unconfident.
# knowledge manifestion and [acquisition](http://people.loyno.edu/~folse/arisepis.html)
knowledge manifests in many ways. For example, we can understand linux kernel by reading source code or reading kernel books.
Either way will help us achieve our goal. But which one is better?
we should know what the goal of learning is. The goal of learning is to find the origins by thinking for oneself.
So reading source code and reading don't matter. But reading source code usually consumes lots time. reading book will loses the reality of knowledge.
Anyway, origins is first. The implemention of kernel has to depend on lots of facts which isn't necessary for understanding a knowledge.
The implemention-specific things do belong to the understanding. it belongs to doing.

103 第一个skb->frag_list的成员. 用的不太多啊.
104 ip_append_data中间出了以为如果可以ufo 那么就到frags的碗里去!
105 否则就生成一串skb挂到&sk->sk_write_queue上,
1. origins and thinking for my self.
2. knowledge in programming language
3. knowledge in human language
4. implemetion-specific which are unnecessary for understanding. Should be avoided.

SO I prefer origins and thinking for myself.
origins should be problems +(optional solving method) adn there are some pure origins which don't have explicity problem with them.
