# Change
The essence of this world is change. 
## attribute
Limit/border of change
## Emotion
I know I will be lost and confused in my whole life.

小步快跑, Fast.
Few is more.

[知之为知之,不知为不知,是知也.](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_679ef4210102vsud.html) 
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones - I have not squandered myself. -- N
不要一味盲目追求「高级感」，而忽视「小事」/「简单事」/「基础事」
参考psychology.
知识不应是概念游戏, 而应该具有生命力, 是生长出来. “记录在纸上的思想，不过是像在沙上行走者的足迹而已，我们也许能看到他所走过的路径；如果我们想要知道他在路上看见些什么，则必须用我们的眼睛” - Schopenhauer
观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清.
不要成为跑马场, 叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔. 
Think for yourself.
事实　我们要实事求是，现在像贴贴标语，什么打倒田中义一等，都仅务虚名，像豆腐店里生意不好，看看“对我生财”泄闷一样。又像是以前的画符，一画符病就好的思想。贴了打倒帝国主义，帝国主义就真个打倒了么？这不对，我们应做切实的工作，奋力的做去。 -- Hu Shi
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.

LQO/ignore unreleated contents.

# Uncertain
Radical fallibility;
Discount from thoughts to reality;defect; An excellent goal can only produce a decent result,while a common result can only be given by a decent goal.;取法乎上，仅得其中；取法乎中，仅得其下
Hypothesize bravely/boldly, to prove carefully
Don't limit yourself. Walk on air. Espcailly make a plan in terms of time. What is fixed or not.

# Mind 
Subjective assume
Imperfect Understanding and radical fallibity are the natue of human.
## Current mind status
It's very difficult to uproot deepen trenched evils or shortcomings
## Fallacies
过份相信主观能力. 看懂内核代码, 非常耗时, 困难(实现对应的signifiers 非常难找, 有些时候还有歧义, 如packet_rcv的PACKET_LOOPBACK), 费时费力不等于学到的多, 往往意味相反.
看别人的实现, 不仅不能学到知识, 更为糟糕的是破坏了自己的创造力.
不要以为看懂内核代码, 有多了不起. 只要肯投入时间, 谁都能看懂kernel代码, 但是这样值吗?
看内核代码实际是个查找搜索的过程, 及其耗费时间. 收获的只是一个点. 非常不值. 必须要衡量投入产出比. 要看内核实现, 必须要先, 评估能学到什么.
* Trying harder doesn't mean effectness. 不要感动自己, 方法不对,越努力差距越大. 
Vicariousness!!quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy. But it also brings fake. 
Law of the hammer. 
People cannot see something wihout being denominated
填鸭,cramming, rote
Literal learner, 以为学习是纯粹的文字游戏, 没有把知识同实际生活关联, 死知识; 
# Reality
Loss function
Don't Expect Too Much.There is no perfect. Troubles come one by one. It will disapoint you finally.

# Ego
Love yourself; 
自己强才是最终要的。
从多种角度解释自己, 经济社会长顺和我, 哲学.
Don't limit yourself. Don't be paranoid. Don't get religous about specific programming skill.时刻想着如何能变强.
我现在的世界观是极其naive， 脆弱的。
痛苦才会成长。
You get what you did.
## Abilities
Creativity
Mantality: 
即便失落失意也要以强者姿态活下去。
不要局限在自己的圈子
和比你厉害的人在一起，和一流的人工作
牛人心态: 牛人姿态, 会成为牛人, 研究东西，牛人洞察力，牛人水准, 研发出来的需要实战、需要工程化，否则只是玩具，而不能成为真的武器
Nothing new under the sun.

### Encoding
### Storage
Chapter 6 section 1: 记忆还依赖于人的已有的知识结构,只有当输入的信息以不同形式汇入人脑中已有的知识系统时,新的信息才能在头脑中更好地巩固下来。
### Retrieval and Repeat 
复习是学习之母。”每一本重要的书籍都必须一气呵成连续读上两遍。原因之一是在阅读第二遍的时候,我们会更好地理解书中内容的整体关联,而只有知道了书的结尾才会明白书的开头;原因之二就是在第二次阅读的时候,我们的心境、情绪与在第一次阅读时已经有所不同。这样,我们获得的印象也会不一样。情形就好比在不同光线之下审视同一样的物体 --论阅读与书籍
精细进行复述是存储信息最有效的方法,它是指把要记住的内容和已有的知识经验联系起来。存储是信息编码和提取的中间环节,它在记忆过程中有着重要的作用。 - 普通心理学 Chapter 6 section 1

# Principle
Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**; and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.** ... Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.** - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII

Don't start from the pure conceptions, from the real basic problems. Problems before conceptions.
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
