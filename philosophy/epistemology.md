# The being
The essence of this world is being. 
As the world changing, it become more complicated and diffcult to live within it.
I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to live in this world.
We use rational and sensous abilities to live within it.
Imperfect being. I am not other beings.

# Steps
## the learning model and goals of learning
1. recoginzeing the abilites
analyzing, Problem & ability, appriasing
2. Practice
purpose practice
## Biology
monitor the status of inclination and disposition
要合理调配好学习与休息，避免过度透支精力和兴趣，要细水长流
## Think for oneself and 
Encode
0. the first problem might be 'what's the point of it?'
对于一个概念, 自己结合用法, 分析下因果.
之后再看历史, 很多时候历史不完整, 只能看个大概. 如tcp mss.
1. origin covers and No implementions; 天下无码.
前件思考: premises/elements thinking, if no inclination, find the roots/origins, list requests or tasks.
elements law; thinking from the roots.
come very naturally;of itself; spontaneously; automatically
learning is inferencing and creating
Construction game like Cities: Skylines
Jigsaw Puzzles
Creating memory
Chapter 6 section 1
记忆还依赖于人的已有的知识结构,只有当输入的信息以不同形式汇入人脑中已有的知识系统时,新的信息才能在头脑中更好地巩固下来。
无论时间是否充裕，都先记“少”
2. Energy flow
3. What could I learn?
### Human index
点线面, 记“少”不记多，反而记更多
Think for oneself.
Using origin and Feynman method, think it **over** from multiple angles/origins and connections(abstracted, no implemention, all in keyword formt), make it coherent.
Since we are just using abstracted conception, it will be independent to implementions. So don't care about the gap between implementions and conceptions.
Think what I should/might learn.
Anrrange the origins based on keywords/origns deductive reasoning.
Retrive just after learning.
Retrive it in another day with empty mind.
* human index vs origins
Human index might be different to origins and implementions since each of them has different emphasis.
origins focus on knowledge itself.
origins is a reflection of implementions.
origins should be incoherent, missing, confusion. It's knowledge fault.
human index focus on human
Human index attaches keywords or origins to signifiers.
these keywords and origins are generated by reflections
human index 
受限于问题, 演绎的效果和实际可能很大偏差, 但是有效的.
注意潜在的复杂知识怪物. 比如dentry的lru, 虽然知识死的一部分, 可lru却很复杂.
成手思维.
一花一世界.
## Repeat Habit & Gradual doing
复习是学习之母。”每一本重要的书籍都必须一气呵成连续读上两
遍。原因之一是在阅读第二遍的时候,我们会更好地理解书中内容的整体
关联,而只有知道了书的结尾才会明白书的开头;原因之二就是在第二次
阅读的时候,我们的心境、情绪与在第一次阅读时已经有所不同。这样,
我们获得的印象也会不一样。情形就好比在不同光线之下审视同一样的物
体 --论阅读与书籍
11. Today and Second day rehearse.
精细进行复述是存储信息最有效的方法,它是指把要记住的内容和已有的知识
经验联系起来。存储是信息编码和提取的中间环
节,它在记忆过程中有着重要的作用。 - 普通心理学 Chapter 6 section 1

# Psychology methods
* Think for oneself - Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII
Don't start from the pure conceptions, from the real basic problems.
Problems before conceptions.
Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, 
so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth
much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over.
The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**;
and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity
between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to
the other.
Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as
foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at
the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its
stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to
think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has
absolutely no inclination or disposition.**
...
Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a
spring when a weight is continually applied to it;
This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple
than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers
of every success.**
“记录在纸上的思想，不过是像在沙上行走者的足迹而已，我们也许能看到他所走过的路径；如果我们想要知道他在路上看见些什么，则必须用我们的眼睛”
观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清.

理性思维做理性思维的事情, 不要浪费宝贵的理性思维去常识记忆细节.
拒绝填鸭,cramming, rote
* Learning by doing: 从动手中学习, 创造知识.

不要成为跑马场, 叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔. 
事实　我们要实事求是，现在像贴贴标语，什么打倒田中义一等，都仅务虚名，像豆腐店里生意不好，看看“对我生财”泄闷一样。又像是以前的画符，一画符病就好的思想。贴了打倒帝国主义，帝国主义就真个打倒了么？这不对，我们应做切实的工作，奋力的做去。 -- Hu Shi
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 --Goethe
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
1. Don't start from the pure conceptions, from the real basic problems. Problems before conceptions.
2. The implemention-specific things do belong to the understanding. it belongs to doing.

Trying harder doesn't mean effectness.
Vicariousness!!quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
Law of the hammer. 
People cannot see something wihout being denominated
## Cases
a) What I learned from learning English and Kernel
做事情, 方法不对, 越努力越悲惨. 只有努力绝对不会成功, 相反会很悲惨.努力人人可以, 世界也不缺少努力的人.
* Fan shuangshuang network stack, kernel, and English
Broke the Law because of overconfident subjective understanding and memory ability.(Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications)
* Learn kernel and this country and world
我之前喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则罔, 书籍让我记住了现成的“事实”，却没有给我产生出这些知识的能力.
除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应.--Why I Am So Clever  Section8
imperfect being: 1 & 2
* English
目标不清楚, 目标模糊没有量化; 方法也没有量化. Subjective assume and Lack of quantatifications
Unconfident.
