# Causality
[Aristotle: we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)
If you don't control youself, you will be definitely controlled by others.
[Richard Feynman. Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA)
Firo: some causes are very intutive. However, others are not easy to be deduced theoritically.

# Will
Self control and free. - Kant.
休谟更是猛烈地攻击了传统理性主义，他在《人性论》中说：理性是感性(Firo: 非理性) 的奴隶，除了服务和服从感性之外，再也不能有任何其他的作用。他认为理性本身是不存在的，纯理性不足以产生任何行动和意志作用。一切理性推理都不过是一种感觉。不但在文学艺术中，就是在哲学和科学中，我们也得遵循我们的爱好和情趣。
## If you don't control yourself, you will be controlled by others.
you lose yourself.
## Future
It’s easier to invent future than to predict it. — Alan Kay

# Structure
Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**; and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.** ... Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.** - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology
## Model of thinking - [Linus Torvalds talking with Aalto University students 11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDEce3mtkRg)
## Different structure.
If you not spend too much time on understanding specific things. Then, it will show different structure rather than learning it thoroughly

# History
The Archaeology of Knowledge

# Uncertainty and unended quest and hypotheses
hypotheses, action plan, certainty

法乎其上，得乎其中，法乎其中，仅得其下
Continuousness, completeness, consistency, soundness. -- Logic
## specific, use positive result not negative result to guide yourself.
## Tendency and mini habits
"“Be the person with embarrassing goals and impressive results instead of one of the many people with impressive goals and embarrassing results.”
## Reward Mechanism
gay science, showoff
## indirect cause, by-product.
## SMART
## SWOT: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats.
## Leave questions open 
there are always some knowledge which is too complicated to understand and we should leave them alone.

## Falsifiability 
## Limitations, restrictions
## Feasibility
Critical thinking: 
Hyposis and test; Trail and error; Reflexcity -- Soros
Hypothesize bravely/boldly, to prove carefully
Feedback: 英语 是模仿与实践, 英语不是理性能得出的, 是大量模仿实践. 理论很少， 而且尽量减少理论投入

# Complexcity
Abstraction(up and down, overall control, and refinement), simplification, dividing
No silver bullet. The Mythical Man-Month
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications
The philosophy of software design
## Detail complexcity and dynamic complexcity
See chapter 20 Rewriting the Code of The Fifith discipline.

## Code complete 2
In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.

Dijkstra pointed out that no one’s skull is really big enough to contain a modern com-
puter program (Dijkstra 1972 The Humble Programmer), which means that we as software developers
shouldn’t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to orga-
nize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time.
The goal is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one
time. You might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program
requires you to keep in the air at once, the more likely you’ll drop one of the balls,
leading to a design or coding error.

# Abyss
## Losing the self. Colonized by others.
Amusing ourselves to death.
The Society of the Spectacle
Kakurenbo
assimilated by language, reluctant to use new language.
## Lost understanding of causality in complexcity and uncertanty.
Lost cause and , in turn, the effect.
lost the feeling of 'Love before BC'; Fading.

Writers are different to you. They don't know wht you really want.
The creators are different to you, too. You are not only lack of what they created, but also ablities they used to create things. Unerstanding vs creation.
Unerstanding always has some drawbacks: incomplete, wrong, vicroness.

# Think for yourself
“记录在纸上的思想，不过是像在沙上行走者的足迹而已，我们也许能看到他所走过的路径；如果我们想要知道他在路上看见些什么，则必须用我们的眼睛” - Schopenhauer
不要成为跑马场, 叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔. 
观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清. -- Wang Yin
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 -- Goethe
Don't start from the pure conceptions, from the real basic problems. Problems before conceptions.
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations

The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made. -- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

### Good order, expection, problem, weakness.
Compplexcity and uncertanty could prevent us from procuring cause. And the effect. So good order is mandatory.
It implies detest and disgust
Classify or container/protection or tidy & tidy up

### Learning by doing
Output. what you did define you.
我们要实事求是，现在像贴贴标语，什么打倒田中义一等，都仅务虚名，像豆腐店里生意不好，看看“对我生财”泄闷一样。又像是以前的画符，一画符病就好的思想。贴了打倒帝国主义，帝国主义就真个打倒了么？这不对，我们应做切实的工作，奋力的做去。 -- Hu Shi
#### Purpose practice
深刻感受自己不足. 感受灵活熟练使用能力. 二者的差距. 做不到的桎梏.
