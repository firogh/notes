# The being
The essence of this world is being. 
As the world changing, it become more complicated and diffcult to live within it.
I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to live in this world.
Willpower: An idea is like a seed; once planted in a person's mind, it's growth is determined by how well it is nourished. Without lasting relevance it might wither and die or become ousted by other ideas that occupy a larger space in the mindspace of the host. Some ideas though, once planted, strike roots and grow from a captivating notion into a fundamental ideology that overshadows and influences every thought that blossoms in it's wake." -- Homo Ludens or: Kojima's Evolution of Mankind (Death Stranding), RagnarRox
We use rational and sensous abilities to live within it.
## The drawbacks of human's reasoning;  Imperfect Understanding and radical fallibity are the natue of human.
1. collect and process information. 灯下寻针. 盲人摸象.
2. 分析 推理. 路径依赖, 类比. first principle 有些时候应该用.
3. 决策和行动. 优柔寡断, 纸上谈兵.
4. 存在即合理，无视甚至鄙视这些存在于人性、系统之中的“潜规则”，才是大大的不合理。
Law of the hammer. 
* Huge amount of complicated information: Fan shuangshuang network stack, kernel, and English
Broke LoHL because of overconfident subjective understanding and memory ability. Only Understanding.
我之前喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则罔, 书籍让我记住了现成的“事实”，却没有给我产生出这些知识的能力.
Literal learner, 以为学习是纯粹的文字游戏, 没有把知识同实际生活关联, 死知识; 
除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应.--Why I Am So Clever  Section8
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!—That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. --Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
* People cannot see something wihout being denominated
* Watch out vicariousnees!!quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
# Law of Human learning
## Basic forms
* Understanding.
* Doing: action, Output, rearrang, ...
事实　我们要实事求是，现在像贴贴标语，什么打倒田中义一等，都仅务虚名，像豆腐店里生意不好，看看“对我生财”泄闷一样。又像是以前的画符，一画符病就好的思想。贴了打倒帝国主义，帝国主义就真个打倒了么？这不对，我们应做切实的工作，奋力的做去。 -- Hu Shi
Learning by doing: 从动手中学习, 创造知识.
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 --Goethe

* Long-term and gradual improvement

## Sensous factors for learning
* Showing-off: in front of interviewer. [装逼](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30178891/answer/205055193)谷歌表示，该中心将在北京拥有一个专家团队，谷歌已在北京有数百名从事研发和其他工作的员工。谷歌AI中国中心将由李飞飞和李佳领导。李飞飞是斯坦福大学人工智能实验室的负责人，领导着谷歌云业务的人工智能部门；李佳是谷歌云业务的人工智能部门研发主管。
* the sense of achievement
进一寸有一寸的欢喜 -- Hu Shi
## What content do we need to learn first? Especially for a large amount of complicated information
* working set, 有时可能需要简单的书来入门,然后就可以自己思考了.
* Life-relevant: 现学的不用，现用的不学 -- 金伟榕 https://www.zhihu.com/question/38206533
* 有生命的活知识
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones - I have not squandered myself. -- N
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.

## Thinking and creating(分析综合?) before every thing and First principles
拒绝填鸭,cramming, rote

## Common Simplicity Methods for mastering complex world
Occam's razor 
Leave a question open 
[Descartes's methods][6]
MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive).
Abstraction
Causality [Causal reasoning][8]
critical thinking
Reflexicity -- Soros
Feynman method

Experiment[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability][3]
## World of origins
# Humble methods
Goal, self-believing humble doing methods & Risk management, feedback
# knowledge forms
JIT e.g. kindle narrtion, soramimi
Abstruction:
Knowledge: base the analysis on life(using)
Qunataty: great large number => Working set, JIT, Knowledge >> life: Infinitive dissipation
Complexicty/granularity: centric high/large => abstaction, causality
Complexicty/granularity: well-distributed, low/small => practice
Causality or practice
Material: Character, sound
Working set: 
onset-nucleus pair: yes for kernel 
procedure or descriptive knowledge bias: English and kernel are both procedure knowledge
复杂的解决方案背后,往往是由简单的问题引出.问题总是简单的，如果不能简单的描述符问题，说明还没弄明白。
* 死知识, Life-relevant: learn in real-life, no dead knowledge
