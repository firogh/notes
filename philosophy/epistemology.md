# The invisiable world
Mind is restricted by how it is represented.
Imagination is more important than knowledge. Wanderer in darkness.

# Chaos
don’t try to make it logical

# Time, hui bu qu
It’s easier to invent future than to predict it. — Alan Kay
Denial of reliazation of death will lose control of time. - Firo
Strategy is the art of making use of time and space. I am less chary of the latter than the former. Space we can recover, lost time never. —Napoleon Bonaparte

# Causality
[Aristotle: we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes)
[Richard Feynman. Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA)
Causality means concrete. All surround causality.

# Complexcity
No silver bullet. The Mythical Man-Month, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, The philosophy of software design
## Detail complexcity and dynamic complexcity - chapter 20 Rewriting the Code of The Fifith discipline.
## Code complete 2
In my view, it’s so important that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative has to be managing complexity.
... Dijkstra pointed out that no one’s skull is really big enough to contain a modern computer program (Dijkstra 1972 The Humble Programmer), which means that we as software developers shouldn’t try to cram whole programs into our skulls at once; we should try to organize our programs in such a way that we can safely focus on one part of it at a time. The goal is to minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time. You might think of this as mental juggling—the more mental balls the program requires you to keep in the air at once, the more likely you’ll drop one of the balls, leading to a design or coding error.

# Will, the cause
休谟更是猛烈地攻击了传统理性主义，他在《人性论》中说：理性是感性(Firo: 非理性) 的奴隶，除了服务和服从感性之外，再也不能有任何其他的作用。他认为理性本身是不存在的，纯理性不足以产生任何行动和意志作用。一切理性推理都不过是一种感觉。不但在文学艺术中，就是在哲学和科学中，我们也得遵循我们的爱好和情趣。

# Problems world
Purposes: Don't spent time on what it is. Focus on the purposes and do it yourself.
Ablities, skilss: Engineer ablities

# Life
Physical(including Biology) and mental world; independence/free will and control by the Other; Abilities and Procedural thinking and chaning world; Think and doing; subjectiv building and role based knowledge vs Subjectivity. In-thing vs Out-observing. Protection and Tidy; top-down vs bottom-up; de-symblize smantic and express yourself; mental arbitrariness vs physical concidence;
# Abilities and chaning world
Basic abilities
Define yourself based on your abilites from the chaning perspective.

# Mental world
Work on a realife problem.
Language must be restored to real life. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein

# Mental arbitrariness
Concrete problems is the basis of understanding; no concrete no gain.
Mental in-thing. Physical in-thing. Don't do mental out-observing.
Close and far connection; primary and secondary.

# Independence and the Other 
马蝇天下The Bots Masters 
什么是独立呢?“独立”是你们自己的事，给你自由而不独立这是奴隶，独立要不盲从，不受欺骗，不依傍门户，不依赖别人，不用别人耳朵为耳朵，不以别人的脑子为脑子，不用别人的眼睛为眼睛，这就是独立的精神。 -- 胡适在北京大学1946年开学演讲
The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgement should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge.  - on education, Albert Einstein
## If you don't control yourself, you will be controlled by others. In turn, you lose yourself. - Firo

# In-thing and out-observing
In-thing vs out-observing: The creators are different to you, too. You are not only lack of what they created, but also ablities they used to create things. Unerstand vs create.

process to 'see'/experience philosophy vs symbols only
dependent knowledge, the underlying vs superfical knowledge
vs name of something, symbols
vs foreign to the drift and temper
causality vs reverse causalaity
extension vs intension
vs 纸上得来终觉浅。 observation limited by symbols, named only.
Focus energy on goals. vs the wanderer, unlimited scope vague goals

John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding: The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining ideas [...] 2. [..] it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

# Effective ways
Do what you really want to do.
If you want to do something, but you are afraid to do it, then that is likely what you should do.

记少不记多,反而记更多; 时间是否充裕,都先记少. So I saw the less is more in action: the more studies, the less obvious elementary but fundamental things become; activity, on the other hand, strips things to their simplest possible model. -- Antifragile, Nassim. First, we can do it. Second, less will make more because we know the foundations before other things. 基础的简单的事.

Learn by doing/creating: 创造/突破/结构成长
I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death. -Leonardo da Vinci

# Subjectivity
Different minds; different behavoir; Relative minds. Writers are different to you. They don't know wht you really want.
Vicariousness, Illusion of Competence

# Doing: Learning by doing

# Structure, form
Just as the largest library, badly arranged, is not so useful as a very moderate one that is well arranged, so the greatest amount of knowledge, if not elaborated by our own thoughts, is worth much less than a far smaller volume that has been abundantly and repeatedly thought over. The difference between the effect produced on the mind by thinking for oneself and that produced by reading is **incredibly great**; and thus it is for ever **increasing the original disparity between minds**, by virtue whereof we are driven to the one or to the other. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and **then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition.** ... Therefore the **mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading** as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; This practice is the reason why **erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.** - Schopenhauer Parerga and Paralipomena Vol.2 Chapter XXII
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology

# Think for yourself[TFY](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Thinking_for_Oneself)
Schopenhauver on reading and books: When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process.
Schopenhauver on reading and books: From all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints in the sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he saw on the way, one requires his eyes.
Schopenhauer: “记录在纸上的思想，不过是像在沙上行走者的足迹而已，我们也许能看到他所走过的路径；如果我们想要知道他在路上看见些什么，则必须用我们的眼睛”
Wang Yin: 观看阅读别人创造的现成的内容, 能让人短暂的知道哪些东西是怎么实现的, 却不能让你获得创造那样内容的能力. 即便是看似最简单基础的内容都无法理清.
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak(Firo: also the dawn of day) or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this. -- Ecce Homo Nietzsche, Why I write such good books, Review of Human, All Too Human section 4.(Firo: search bookwormery)

# First principle, then minimum essential fundamentals. 
“I tend to approach things from a physics framework,” Musk said in an interview. “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.” - Elon Musk

# Learning by doing/creating - what you did defines you. reinvent, creating, using.
[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Leonardo_da_Vinci): I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.
Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics: For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.
Feynman mean: [What I cannot create, I do not understand?](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand)
Goethe: 我们必须流下热汗, 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产.
Ray Dalio: knowing how to deal well with you setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward. -- 
John Dewey: [D is for John Dewey: His Approach To Education](https://www.thepositiveencourager.global/john-deweys-approach-to-doing-positive-work/)
Montaigne: We take other men’s knowledge and opinions upon trust; which is an idle and superficial learning. We must make them our own. We are just like a man who, needing fire, went to a neighbor’s house to fetch it, and finding a very good one there, sat down to warm himself without remembering to carry any back home. What good does it do us to have our belly full of meat if it is not digested, if it is not transformed into us, if it does not nourish and support us?

## Purpose practice
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html)
Thomas Sterner, The Practicing Mind: When we practice something, we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal. The words deliberate and intention are key here because they define the difference between actively practicing something and passively learning it.

# Knowledge
Schopenhauver on reading and books: We can never read the bad too little and the good too often. Inferior books are intellectual poison; they ruin the mind.
活知识; the ability of Swim and learning of history; Define the question, restore to life and causlaity; Architecture: common causes for many effects. Just for fun.
