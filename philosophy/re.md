title: Quantitative cognition - The philosophy on which I am living
category: philosophy
---
I am aware of that we need some principles and methods to understand this world.
# knowledge forms
Abstruction:
Life-relevant:learn in real-life, no dead knowledge
Knowledge: base the analysis on life(using)
Qunataty: great large number => Working set, JIT, Knowledge >> life: Infinitive dissipation
Complexicty/granularity: centric high/large => abstaction, causality
Complexicty/granularity: well-distributed, low/small => practice
Causality or practice
Material: Character, sound
Working set: 
## the kernel forms
Qunataty: great large number => work set, JIT
Complexicty/Granularity: centric high/large => abstaction, causality
Causality or practice:causality
Material: writen
Work-set: yes
# The Life
0. Memory knowledge, it's the bigset part I used to do.机械的摄入, 使自己成为智障. 
1. 死知识, life-relevant using
[知识的“局限性”][1] 碎片化的知识无用, 碎片化知识切割人生.
Showing-off: in front of interviewer. [装逼](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30178891/answer/205055193)
谷歌表示，该中心将在北京拥有一个专家团队，谷歌已在北京有数百名从事研发和其他工作的员工。谷歌AI中国中心将由李飞飞和李佳领导。李飞飞是斯坦福大学人工智能实验室的负责人，领导着谷歌云业务的人工智能部门；李佳是谷歌云业务的人工智能部门研发主管。
I have never thought about questions that are not real ones—I have not squandered myself. -- N
[知之为知之，不知为不知，是知也。][2] 区分无用的知识.
[What is science by Feyman][5], do you know brown-throated thrush?
Automatic Thinking, 人脑自动关联, 演绎, 可以被忽略的不分.
2. 循序渐进, gradual improvement, working set, gradient, content state
[The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability][3]
Occam's razor
Follow consective sequent logic
the transpoints, 不可以被忽略的不分.
3. 低品质勤奋的人, 所有时间都花在学习上了．学得想吐, 感动自己．
4. Output is better than input
5. Sound is stornger than memory to remember things
* 对无知的无知
* practice/experiment, abstruction, causlity
* Active learning: is the first criterian for measuring learning effect
How much we understand the world isn't better than how well.
不要成为跑马场, 叔本华晚年整理的论文杂集《附录和补遗》里的《论思考》第4节 别人的跑马场. or in 叔本华美学随笔.
拒绝填鸭,cramming!.时间长.
* mode: JIT e.g. kindle narrtion, soramimi
* Feynman and [Descartes's methods][6]
![his blackboard at the time of death](http://archives.caltech.edu/pictures/1.10-29.jpg)
* Affirmative and negative description, Critical rationalism, Failsibility,Trial and error.
MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive).
onset的反面不是coda, 而是nucleus.
* Learning by doing: 从动手中学习, 创造知识.
[What did Richard Feynman mean when he said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand"?][4]
我们必须流下热汗 才能真正拥有父亲留下的遗产 --Goethe
[Take the programs, modify them and enhance them.][7]  --Stevens
* learn target: working set
Know how to solve every problem that has been solved. --Feynman
## stereotype prototype 
0. Plunge into things
1. literal learner, 以为学习是纯粹的文字游戏, 没有把知识同实际生活关联, 死知识. 
2. 缸中之脑, 将生活维持在大脑刺激当中, 而不是真正的生活, fake life.
3. 所有时间都投入到学习中
## Enlightened suffer's increasing of wisdom
0. nonego, out of knowledges, never experinced
分析知识, 分析自身-> life-relevant->有生命的活知识(让人满意的, 感到满足畅快的）->循序渐进-> Practiced professional
1. Analyzing the basic forms
* abstruction
* Life-relevant: no dead knowledge, We are facing the world; Vigor is limited.I cannot do everything.
From question, not zero
* Causality or practice: 
* procedure or descriptive knowledge. 围棋规则 or 围棋高手. python一旦确定用的场景, 语言本身迅速消失, 留下用的样子. 没有纯粹的过程 或者 陈述知识, 知识偏重.
2. Step by step:循序渐进
3. Feedback
Reflexicity -- Soros/Statistics-based method training. --Firo
Risk management:
Tactical error. strategic error: If stracegic is too large, it will lead tactical error.
不带有色眼光的, 看待事情知识本身. 别说什么你不感兴趣, 有些内容与计算机无关. 这都容易, 造成认知对象的消失, 从而偏见与盲目.
# The origins of the world
* Causality is abyss. Watch out origins.[Causal reasoning][8]
* Don't Expect Too Much.There is no perfect. Troubles come one by one. It will disapoint you finally.
* Nothing new under the sun.
* If one thing is a must, do it now.
* Our minds is always fickle, unstable, vacillating. Sometimes the important side is that our minds is partial, biased, unreliable. We cannot rely on it.
* Just-in-time and Just-in-case
Causality order  quantities change relation.
Storage: access diffent
Computing: diffent object
dependency, direction
Scalable
Cthulhu, unkonw world, hard to measure, unfalsifiable, unreality, unfathomable, Indeterminacy, unmeasurable, imponderable,indefinite, 
Repeat, irregularity, complexity
onset, nuclus, coda
Completeness, consistency, validity, soundness. -- Logic
The whole is other than the sum of the parts. --Gestalt psychology
Schedule: Distributing the workloads across resources.
## resource
Track, using alloc, return
overhead,
## the properties of knowledge
* Watch out vicariousnees!!quick understanding, no complex brain labors, it's easy.But it also brings fake. 
* 不要被知识迷惑, declarative knowledge和Procedural knowledge不能互相取代. 每种知识的关注点是不同的, 也就是逻辑链不同, 虽然看似学得是同样的内容, 实质上, 本后的逻辑完全不同. 精通围棋规则和精通围棋. 如王垠所言, 在计算机领域，很多人喜欢抱着大部头的专业书籍看，其实那是事倍功半的努力。学而不思则殆,就是这个道理。书籍让你记住了现成的“事实”，却不能让你拥有产生出这些知识的能力.
* 以现实和精神, 这两个词为例, 这并不是真实存在, 只是认为定义的.We don't have to remember/understand the things contrived by people. What we need to remember is the fact which leads this contriving!
* "除了浸沉于书籍之海不做别的事情的学者……最后则是完全丧失了为自己而思考的才能。除非有一本书在手里，他就不能思考。当他思考，他只是反应一种刺激即他所看到的别人的思想，结果他所做的一切都是反应。 -- N Why I Am So Clever  Section8
* 叔本华思想随笔: 论思考
* Human, All Too Human With Two Continuations
All by themselves my eyes put an end to all bookwormery, otherwise known as philology: I was released from the ‘book’, and read nothing more for years—the greatest favour I have ever done myself!—That nethermost self, as if buried alive, as if made mute beneath the constant need to pay heed to other selves (—which is what reading is!) awoke slowly, shyly, hesitantly—but finally it spoke again. I have never been so happy with myself as in my life’s periods of greatest illness and pain: you need only take a look at Daybreak or The Wanderer and His Shadow to understand what this ‘return to myself ’ was: the highest kind of recuperation!... The other kind simply followed on from this.
* 它们只是把你“训练”（train）成了循规蹈矩的流水线工人，而不能让你受到真正的“教育”（education）。真正的好书都是很薄的，“把厚书读薄”这句话其实是误导的。厚书本来就不应该拿来读，最多可以拿来当字典查。所以我的建议是：如果你想成为天才，就避免去读厚书。去寻找简短的书来入门，然后就可以自己思考了。这就是我从 Nash 的故事得到的启发。 Wangyin
* Overconfident subjective understanding. -- on larning kernel
* Willpower: An idea is likes a seed; once planted in a person's mind, it's growth is determined by how well it is nourished. Without lasting relevance it might wither and die or become ousted by other ideas that occupy a larger space in the mindspace of the host. Some ideas though, once planted, strike roots and grow from a captivating notion into a fundamental ideology that overshadows and influences every thought that blossoms in it's wake." -- Homo Ludens or: Kojima's Evolution of Mankind (Death Stranding), RagnarRox
* People cannot see something wihout being denominated
*  复杂的解决方案背后，往往是由简单的问题引出。问题总是简单的，如果不能简单的描述符问题，说明还没弄明白。
